Introduction





The coffee shop had worked me like a mad woman today. With the Christmas holidays approaching in the mall there wasn’t even time for a break. I needed the longer hours but my feet were killing me and I was glad it was close to closing time. All I wanted to do tonight was sink into a hot bath and relax. Glancing up at the clock I sighed in relief noticing there was only half an hour left.

“Miss Burns?” A deep, masculine voice pulled my attention to a handsome, well-groomed man standing at the front counter. I’d seen attractive men before obviously, but none that took my breath away with a single look before.

“I’m Laura, how can I help you?” My eyes clashed with his deep blue depths, and I felt my stomach clench in some strange sensation that made my heart race.

“Taylor Ross.” His full lips lifted in a confident smile and he extended a manicured hand over the counter.

The strange butterflies filling my stomach at his smile left me staring at him in confusion before I accepted his greeting. The feel of his warm palm against mine forced a sigh from my lips and my face flooded with color.

His face seemed vaguely familiar, but I knew if I’d met this man before I wouldn’t have forgotten. “I’m sorry, but have we met?” Snapping out of fantasy land I gave my libido a mental kick.

“My father is Leonard Ross.” His brow lifted and he seemed to be searching my face for some recognition.

With a smile I realized this was Lenny’s son. Lenny was one of my favorite customers and a regular. I hadn’t seen him in a few weeks and I missed his wisdom.

“Lenny is such a sweetheart.” My smiled broadened as I thought about all the advice he’d offered me this year. “How’s he doing? This place hasn’t been the same without him.”

Lenny helped me not panic when my mother had run off with her newest attraction a few months ago. He reminded me that I had the inner strength to rise above any challenge. She’d taken everything from the house but at least hadn’t depleted my savings account. I had a little put back for my college education but thanks to her dropping the ball on her part of the rent, it forced me to realize I would have to put off my dreams for another year while I recouped.

Lenny had offered me money to help offset some of my losses but I couldn’t take advantage of our friendship that way. He was a nice old man but I was too proud and wouldn’t take his charity. Living with a mother who used people left and right, I refused to accept handouts.

“I’d like to talk to you about that. Privately.” His handsome face took on a stern expression and my smile vanished.

“Um. Okay. I’ll be closing up soon?” I had no idea what he could need to talk to me about, but I respected Lenny enough to show his son a little common courtesy.

“I’ll wait then.” He gave a curt nod of his head, then walked over to sit down at one of the tables.

The crowd was thinning out as closing time for the mall approached and I started doing my nightly prep work for closing. Working here was relatively easy and the cleanup didn’t take long. With everything stocked for tomorrows opening, I cashed out the drawer and walked the nightly receipts and profit back to the manager’s office.

My feet were dragging and I wanted to get home quickly. I hoped whatever Lenny’s son had to speak with me about wouldn’t take long. Granted he was a nice visual distraction but I didn’t have time in my life to consider men in that way.

I grabbed my purse from under the counter and walked over to his table. “I need to lock up. Maybe we can talk on my way out?” Trying not to be rude I offered a tentative smile. Having a conversation at my place of employment after hours wasn’t something upper management approved of. The owners were decent people but they expected all their employees to do the job they were paid for and reminded us often that we worked for them.

“I’m afraid this conversation might take a little time. Perhaps we could go for a drive?”

“I hope you don’t take this the wrong way, but I don’t know you.” The man was impeccably dressed and his father was a nice man, but still he was a stranger. Courtesy was one thing, being irresponsible, another.

“I understand your hesitation but my driver will be with us. You’ll be safe in my company.” His smile, which I assumed was meant to be reassuring, didn’t meet his eyes and did little to make me feel comfortable.

I didn’t understand the feelings this man brought out in me. Men didn’t really touch my radar. My goals involved getting an education and making a better life for myself. Relationships didn’t factor into my bottom line. So why this man had me interested, I couldn’t say.

“Just a moment of your time Miss Burns. I would prefer speaking to you in private.” I could tell instantly that he was a man accustomed to getting his way and for some reason I didn’t want to deny him. I nodded.

He waited as I locked the door to the coffee shop and then followed at my side as we exited the mall. A limo was waiting and my confused eyes met his. “You obviously weren’t kidding when you said you had a driver.” Who was this man? I assumed Lenny was successful but obviously he was more than I’d imagined.

“I always say what I mean Miss Burns.” A small smile touched his lips as he led me toward the car by resting his hand on the small of my back.

People didn’t pull up to the mall in limousines normally. Who had the type of money that afforded someone the privilege of being escorted around this way? No one I was associated with.

The driver walked around to the back passenger door and opened it. For a moment I felt a sense of panic. Getting into a car with a stranger was never a smart idea. “Maybe you should just tell me what this is about.” I took a few steps away from the open door and crossed my arms over my chest. There were still people filing out of the mall so I felt relatively safe.

He ran a long-fingered hand through his dark hair and the look he gave spoke of impatience. “I wanted to break this to you in a more delicate manner but obviously you don’t trust me. My father has passed away.”

For a moment I stared at him dumbfounded. The last time I’d seen Lenny, he seemed vibrant and full of health. “But he didn’t look sick?” I really liked Lenny and the thought of not talking to him again made my heart ache.

“It was rather sudden.” His expression wasn’t what I expected for a man who’d just lost his father. Actually he looked irritated. “He left instructions about helping you and that’s why I think we need to talk.”

Why on earth would Lenny do something like that? We had talked about my goals and dreams but he certainly didn’t owe me anything. Just speaking with him had helped me decide on the path I wanted to take with my life. “Your father was very nice to me, but I’m sure you have more important things to deal with at the moment.”

A strange look entered his eyes and I didn’t know how to decipher it. All I can say is it left him looking less annoyed and maybe somewhat confused. “Be that as it may, I need to honor my father’s final wishes. At least talk with me.” He motioned toward the open car door and the smile on his face seemed saddened.

The change of attitude made me feel a little guilty for arguing with him. The man had just lost his father after all. I didn’t need his help but if he felt the need to discuss it then I could at least hear him out. I attempted to smile and slid into the leather seat of the limousine.

Being surrounded with such luxury instantly made me feel out of place. I was a jeans and t-shirt kind of girl and this was a caviar type of world. I fidgeted with the collar on my uniform shirt waiting for him to get in. When the door closed behind him I felt claustrophobic.

The man took up entirely too much space even in the spacious backseat. It wasn’t his size, although he was over six feet tall and filled out that business suit extremely well. What really overwhelmed me was his air of confidence, something I’d never possessed.

He rolled down the divider window between us and the driver and told him to circle the block before returning his attention to me. His deep blue eyes seemed to be taking in every inch of my appearance. It was very unnerving. My hands moved to my lap to wring nervously together.

“So how did you and my father meet?” His gaze bore into mine and I immediately looked down at my hands. He intimidated me in ways that I couldn’t explain.

“Um, he came into the coffee shop a year ago and we just hit it off.” Thinking that Lenny and I would never talk again was depressing. The man knew a little about everything and I was like a sponge soaking up his knowledge. He was the reason I wanted to attend college, there were so many things to learn about the world we lived in. My eyes watered and I fought to contain my emotions.

“I didn’t realize you’d known him that long.” His voice seemed laced with steel and I glanced up at his handsome face, shocked by the rage that played on his features again.

I inched a little closer to the door. My mothers’ parade of boyfriends in my life had taught me that an angry man was something to be avoided at all costs. When I was nervous I tended to babble.

“Yeah. I can’t believe it’s been that long. Lenny was so experienced. I swear he taught me more about life than the last twenty years of living it has.” I probably would have kept on talking to cover the fact that he made me nervous, but he cut in.

“You’re just a child!” The wrath in his voice frightened me at first then anger kicked in at his rudeness. I didn’t know this man well enough for him to yell at me and I certainly wasn’t a child. I was doing him the favor by agreeing to talk.

“It’s impolite to scream at people you don’t know. Age has little to do with manners. If that’s how you treat people you can let me out of this car.” I didn’t mean to come unhinged at his comment but I was tired of people thinking they could walk all over me. My mother had done that enough before she decided to abandon me.

“I didn’t mean to be offensive.” His tone calmed and I felt my face flush.

“Sorry. I’m afraid things haven’t been very easy lately. I didn’t mean to take it out on you.” The truth was I didn’t want to be that bitter, angry person my mother had turned into. This man wasn’t at fault for my problems and I felt guilty for adding more burdens on top of the loss he’d already suffered.

“I think I can help you with that.” There was a tick in his jaw even as he attempted a smile.

“Forget I said anything.” Talk about being embarrassed. I didn’t need his help and this conversation wasn’t why I got in the car with him. “I really appreciate that you want to honor your dad’s wishes, but he doesn’t owe me anything.”

“He obviously felt he did. What would it take to get you to a comfortable place Miss Burns?” A stony look fell over his face and I was baffled by his mood swings.

Babbling again, I launched into a quick outline of my goals. “All I want to do is save up for college and make a new life for myself. I’m working on that now so you can rest easy. Lenny gave me the courage to know I could reach that goal. There’s really nothing else I need.”

“Then allow me to pay for your education and expenses to live that dream.” His smile didn’t reach his eyes and my own widened at his generosity.

“I couldn’t do that! I really appreciate the offer but I’m working to pay off some debt and I’ll hopefully start next fall.” If I was anything like my mom I’d jump at his offer, but I had a different set of values. “I really appreciate the thought though.”

“My father obviously cared for you a great deal. It’s the least I can do.” He didn’t sound happy about offering and I knew it was just out of respect for Lenny that he spoke the words.

“Thank you, but I have everything figured out. Your dad gave me more than enough by encouraging me to make goals for myself.” He didn’t need to know I was drowning in debt and doubted my own ability to make that goal a reality. The offer was tempting but I wasn’t a freeloader.

“I’m trying to help you. I’m afraid I wouldn’t be able to sleep at night if I didn’t assure myself that my father’s final words were honored.”

I couldn’t believe that Lenny had even thought of me in his last moments. Yes we were friends, but I’d just assumed his life was full of people that he felt appreciated him. I was just some girl in a coffee shop and we’d never met anywhere else.

“I don’t know how to say this nicely but I wouldn’t feel right taking money from you.” I hoped I was explaining this right.

“So if you won’t take money, what about a position in my company?” Was he gritting his teeth? I understood he wanted to fulfill Lenny’s promises but what I didn’t get was why he seemed so infuriated about it. I was offering him a way out.

“Um, I’ve only worked at the coffee shop. I’m sure I don’t have the experience to work for you.” I knew that Lenny was involved with something that bought and sold companies. I really didn’t understand how that worked.

“We have positions that you can train in while you work. Of course you’d be making a better salary than the one you currently have. If you won’t let me pay for your education, the ‘least’ I can do is offer you a chance to obtain your goals faster.”

I didn’t know what to say. A job making more money would help me out and if he was willing to let me start at the bottom should I refuse? The man didn’t seem like he knew how to take no for answer. “I guess that would be okay.” He seemed determined to do something and this wasn’t really a handout, was it? I mean I would be working.

I watched as he reached into his back pocket and pulled out his wallet. He offered me a business card. “I’m sure we can make this situation work out for both of us.”

Taking the card, I slid it into the pocket on my uniform shirt. “Are you sure this is something you want to do? You really don’t know enough about me to offer a job.”

“Trust me Miss Burns, this will be beneficial for both of us.” The smirk on his face confused me. “Come to my office Monday morning at eight and we’ll take care of all the paperwork.”

“I’ll need to give the coffee shop notice.” I hoped this wasn’t a bad idea. Making more money would help me out, but working for a man not knowing what was involved with the job description was daunting.

“Understandable. I believe your shop opens at ten, so you should still be able to get the paperwork started Monday?”

“Um. Okay.” I looked down at the card again and noted the address for the company was downtown. I had Monday off so the time wasn’t a problem. “I guess we can talk about everything then.” He’d relaxed and I got the feeling he was the type of man accustomed to getting what he wanted.

He rolled down the driver’s window and gave instructions to return to the mall. We didn’t speak on the way back and the entire ride left me feeling very uncomfortable. I thanked him as we pulled back in the parking lot. With a brief nod of his head, he pulled away and left me walking towards the bus stop.





Chapter two





Determined


The house was being sold. I don’t know why I was shocked. My mother seemed determined to ruin my life. Not a phone call or even a letter from her, instead I get a call from the bank telling me I have less than a month to vacate the premises. How could life get much worse?

Two thousand dollars is what I had saved up to start college next year. Now that money would be used on a new apartment. I had no credit line yet so getting a decent place to rent wasn’t going to be easy. Shaking my head I thought about the wedding invitation I’d received in the mail. Amazing how she could send out an invite for that but not a warning I was about to be out in the streets.

For her it was all about appearances. She was moving on to husband number five. While she would enjoy her new life and all the perks that came with it until she bankrupted the new man, I was once again left to deal with what she left behind. It wasn’t like I was a stranger to any of this. I’d been nothing but an afterthought after she destroyed my father, the first man she’d married.

Fighting back tears, I refused to cry over her treachery again instead I took a deep breath. All I wanted was to put her and the insane past behind me for good. If only every time I attempted to do that my feet weren’t kicked out from under me I might have a shot at normalcy.

Positives. That’s what I kept telling myself to look toward. I was going to work with Ross Industries. After the offer I’d researched the company and was amazed at the legacy Lenny had left behind. A fortune 500 company worth billions. Obviously the driver Mr. Ross employed was not working for a rental company.

I hadn’t heard from him since I visited the human resources department for his company last week. I’d finished all the necessary paperwork and pre-employment screenings that day and worried the entire time that I was in over my head. The building was huge and if it hadn’t been for the personal escort by one of the staff I’d have easily gotten lost.

Discovering I would be working as his personal assistant almost made me reconsider taking the job. I couldn’t imagine working in that building at all much less in a position that I assumed was sought after. I was a server at a coffee shop, and felt I didn’t have the experience that working for him required.

If I wanted a way out from the mess my life was becoming, his offer was the best chance I could get. The salary listed on my paperwork was mind blowing. Three times the minimum wage I was earning at the coffee shop. It didn’t matter that I had no idea how to be a personal assistant, for the wages he was paying I’d learn.

I was meeting him today to go over my duties and then I’d start looking for a new place to live. I could only pray this would be the positive change I needed to get my life headed in the right direction. Staring back at my reflection in the mirror, I hoped the church dress I was wearing was appropriate for the position.

Refusing to allow my mind to dwell on the negatives, I pulled my shoulders back and stood up to my full five foot four inch height. Giving my reflection a pep talk for confidence, I smoothed a stray curl away from my face and secured the wayward blonde strands back into a clip.

I wasn’t big on makeup but I needed to look mature enough to play the role of Taylor Ross’s personal assistant. Without the cover up I looked like a girl still in high school. Refreshing the bright red lipstick I thought the dark hues made me appear older. Fighting back a wave of nerves I quickly turned away from my image and retrieved my purse. I was going to make this work.

I’d almost convinced myself of that on the bus ride downtown. Chicago was insanely busy during rush hour and the crowd surrounding me forced me to focus on them instead of my own feelings of inadequacy. The confidence lasted until I was waiting in his office for him to finish a phone conversation.

Everything about the man bespoke power. Not just the physical kind, even though his towering presence definitely was proof of that. It was more about the way he demanded things instead of asked for them. Such confidence was overwhelming to witness and I could only hope someday I had that ability.

The entire time he talked on the phone I reminded myself that he was my lifeline at the moment. I’d given up my job at the coffee shop and if this didn’t work out I was screwed. Wanting to please him wasn’t just a passing thought, it was a necessity. I didn’t feel qualified to be here but I was going to do my best to not disappoint.

“Forgive me for the interruption.” He hung up the receiver and sat back in his imposing office chair, his arms crossing over his wide chest.

Not a hair was out of place, and I self-consciously lifted a hand to my own to make sure a curl hadn’t slipped loose. I started second guessing everything about my appearance because he was just so perfect that I felt inferior.

His eyes were filled with some unfathomable emotion as he looked into mine and I wished I knew what he was thinking. He continued to stare and I fidgeted nervously in my chair. “So. Um. We were going to discuss my duties?”

A small smirk appeared on his face and he gave a brief nod of his head. “Whatever shall I do with you, Miss Burns?” He leaned forward in his chair and large hands splayed over the desk. “For now I will just have you at my beck at call. If I need something I’ll explain it and if you have a problem you’ll let me know.”

His words confused me. I wasn’t sure how to do a job that didn’t have guidelines. “So I just sit here with you until you tell me what you need?” The idea of staring at him all day wasn’t a horrible one, but he was paying me a huge salary to do nothing?

“As intriguing as that idea is I’m sure you’d find it tedious. For now we’ll start with getting you a wardrobe that is more befitting your position. I’ll have my secretary give you an expense account and then we’ll discuss my travel agenda for the next month.”

I felt insecure when he commented on my appearance and hoped the embarrassment didn’t show on my face. “So scheduling your travels will be part of my job?” I wasn’t about to mention the clothing. I had no idea how to dress or what he expected.

“I think we can begin there but you’ll be accompanying me on any trips I take.” He rested his elbow on the table and placed a finger to his lips, seeming to contemplate. “On second thought I believe I’ll take a personal interest in your wardrobe.” He pushed a button on his intercom system and told his secretary to clear his schedule for the day.

I was floored. He was taking me shopping? I obviously didn’t know how to dress like a corporate executive but the thought of spending time alone with Mr. Ross as he made such intimate decisions? That was nerve wracking. “I’m sure you have much better things to do.”

“Your appearance will be a direct reflection on my company, so I am making this a priority.” He stood and allowed his gaze to roam over me again.

I bit my lip, stood up and wished the man didn’t make me feel so nervous. Granted the dress I was wearing was two years old and came from a bargain store, but the idea of him taking a personal interest seemed a little, well too personal. “If you’ll tell me where you shop I’m sure I can take care of this on my own.”

“Until you know more about what you’ll do here at Ross Industries, I’m afraid you can’t understand what is expected of you as an employee. Most of the companies we take over don’t happen in a board room. Social functions prove a much better venue in discovering the true nature of an owners’ interests.”

He expected me to help him social functions? Unless you counted a party on the local college campus, I had no experience in this area. “What exactly does your personal assistant do at these functions?”

“You’re a beautiful young woman and attending these events with me will distract my contacts from my true motives.” He shrugged his shoulder and I fought not to allow my mouth to hang open.

I don’t know what I expected him say but I was floored by his response. “So basically you think I’d be eye-candy?” The fact that he thought I was pretty enough shouldn’t have given me the thrill it did. I should be mortified by what he was proposing.

“I’m glad you understand reality Miss Burns.” The smirk on his face was condescending. “With you by my side I will be given an edge and I’ll reward you nicely for any contracts acquired.”

Part of me wanted to throw his job back in his face, but the realistic side knew that I needed this job. I could probably get the job back at the coffee house but I’d never earn the money I needed making minimum wage. I was going to work for him, but only if my terms were met.

“I’ll agree to this as long as you understand that it’s only for show. When we leave these events, you and I are still employee and boss.” I was stunned that he would hire someone for this position and also offended. Offended didn’t pay my bills though.

“I’m sorry if I gave you the wrong impression but this is all business. Rest assured your charms,” he paused for a moment to glance over me again, “while perfect for what I have in mind, will only be required for the job.”

My face heated at his comment and I understood perfectly. I would do for the illusion he wanted to give for his clients, but he had no personal interest in me. I told myself I was glad he didn’t find me attractive in that way. “As long as we’re clear.”

“Perfectly. Now let’s go turn you into a woman that will turn heads when she enters the room.” He motioned with his hand toward the door and I didn’t waste time in making my way to it.





chapter three





Dress Down


Shopping with Taylor was humbling. He demanded that I model each outfit for him and his eyes devoured my appearance with critique. After trying on dozens of choices my mood was bordering on rage and I wondered if what he was doing could be classified as sexual harassment.

Comments about how certain outfits didn’t enhance my bust line or made my legs look shorter than what they were, couldn’t be considered professional etiquette. By the time he was finally satisfied I was clenching my hands into fists by my sides.

He wasn’t finished after the clothing because he led me to the lingerie department next. Blushing furiously, I watched him study several skimpy pieces and my patience reached its limit. “I am not showing off my under garments to your clients Mr. Ross. Why should I be fitted for such items?” Gritting my teeth I bit the words off trying to control my temper.

He rolled his eyes and motioned to a store clerk instead of answering my question. “Would you say that what’s underneath an outfit matters as much as what’s worn over it?”

“I would. Certain items need different lingerie to keep the lines fluid.” The clerk smiled and seemed to be flirting with Mr. Ross. I glared at them both.

“My associate has a dozen different outfits that need the right lingerie to accompany them. Would you mind helping her choose? I’m sure your experience in this area is more proficient than my own.” He smiled at her and grinned cockily at me.

The woman gushed over how much pleasure she would take in dressing me. It was almost nauseating how sweet her voice has turned. Instead of arguing with him like I wanted, I decided to ignore him completely. If he wanted to waste money on such frivolities, far be it for me to stop him.

I spent another hour in that department before we moved on to shoes. I had no idea how I was going to wear three inch heels and not bust my ass. I wasn’t the most graceful person to begin with, so putting me in them was a disaster waiting to happen.

Taylor seemed amused as I paraded the different shoes for his viewing pleasure and chuckled deeply as I almost tripped over my own feet more than once. “I assume Grace is not your middle name.”

“Obviously gentleman isn’t yours.” Sitting in the leather chair I chunked the last pair of heels back in a box before glaring at him. I didn’t care if he was my boss at the moment. Allowing him to humiliate me wasn’t part of the job description.

“I don’t get paid to spare your feelings. You’ll need to practice walking in the heels during your spare time.” He waved the assistant over and informed him we’d take all eight pairs.

I’d never owned that many shoes in my life. The bills he was racking up on my wardrobe were phenomenal and my irritated feelings eased. “Is all this really necessary?” I was sure the words sounded accusing but I really didn’t understand how someone could waste so much money on clothes.

“Image is everything Miss Burns. A lesson you would do well to remember. The only thing that inspires more confidence is attitude. If you dress the part and prove to your opponents that you have the wit to outsmart them, winning any argument becomes easier.”

I couldn’t argue with his logic even as cold-blooded as it sounded. Honesty had always been my goal, that and taking an interest in the people I spoke with. We couldn’t be more different. “If you say so.”

“I do and if you want to be successful in this job you’ll learn to play by my rules.” He pulled out his cell phone, contacted his driver and gave implicit instructions on picking up his purchases. “We have one more stop and then we can call it a day.”

While most women might have enjoyed the shopping spree, I was exhausted. I still had to go apartment hunting and at this rate my feet were going to be screaming in denial. “What other torture do you have planned for the day?” I didn’t mean to sound frustrated, but I really did need a break.

“We must work on your attitude.” He shook his head and took off in long strides out of the shoe department. I raced to keep up with him, my shorter stature making it difficult. By the time we reached the car I was out of breath.

“For someone so young, you are tiring out quickly. How many days a week are you exercising?” He seemed amused as he turned his gaze my way after we were seated.

“I don’t see how that’s part of my job description.” I had been slacking on my runs for the last month, but in my defense I had other things to worry about.

“You look very fit, but a good workout keeps your heart and body in optimal health.” He rolled down the partition window between us and the driver and gave our destination.

He was taking me to a spa? I’d never been to one before but from what I’d seen and read it was a relaxing experience. “I use to run at least a few miles three times a week but I’ve had other concerns lately.” I wasn’t sure why I confided that piece of information since it really wasn’t any of his business.

“We have a gym at the office, there’s also a track. If you’re going to keep up with my hectic schedule you need to be in top physical form. For now we’ll consider that one of your duties. I expect you to work out at least thirty minutes a day during the week.”

At first I wanted to call him a pompous ass for his demand, then I reconsidered. If he wanted to pay me to work out then why argue. It was something I enjoyed and I had been neglecting my runs lately.

The car pulled up in front of an elegant hotel and for a moment my heart skipped a beat. “Why are we here?” It was crazy to think that he was bringing me here for something not involving business, but it still crossed my mind.

He smirked as he stepped out of the car. “The spa is inside. Believe me I don’t have designs on your person, Miss Burns.”

Sliding out, I thanked the driver for holding the door and fought to hold back my embarrassment. Of course the spa was inside, why else would we be here? Instead of sticking my foot in my mouth again I followed meekly behind him.

He spoke to the woman at the counter explaining he wanted a makeup consultation, manicure and pedicure as well. The woman glanced over at me with a warm smile and invited me back. During the next two hours I was pampered like a queen and even knowing he’d arranged this, I couldn’t help falling in love with the services.

I joined him back in the waiting area feeling calmer than I had since we left this morning. I had a bag full of products from my makeover and even enjoyed learning how to apply them. “Thank you for the experience. I’ve never visited a spa before.”

He seemed confused by my response but nodded his head curtly. “My mother can barely go a week without visiting.” He smiled and it nearly made my knees buckle. It was the first time I’d seen him drop his cocky attitude.

“Your father said she enjoyed being pampered.” I remembered how Lenny’s eyes would light up when he talked about his wife. I’d told myself that one day I’d find a man who loved me that much.

“She deserved to be indulged.” The resentment in his tone was shocking. I wasn’t sure what I’d said that changed his attitude but he left me no time to question. With long strides of his legs he walked toward the exit and I was almost running to keep up again.

We didn’t speak during our drive back to the building and the tension was overwhelming. All I wanted was to escape the hostile vibe he was putting off. “Will you be needing me for anything else today?”

“Already trying to shirk your duties?” His voice was mocking and he raised an eyebrow as he looked at me for the first time since we’d gotten in the car.

“Of course not. I just need to go apartment hunting and thought if we were finished I’d get started.” I had no idea why he displayed such hostility toward me, maybe it was just his nature.

“I wasn’t aware you needed a place to live. How soon were you looking to move in?” He seemed almost concerned now and his attitude flipping back and forth was giving me a headache.

“I have thirty days to vacate the house I’m living in, so as soon as possible.” I needed to learn to bite my tongue, the way I made that sound was I was being evicted. I decided to clarify. “My mother sold our house after her move to Vegas.”

“Not much notice?” His blue eyes bore into mine almost seeming to study them for a response.

I tried to shrug casually, as if it didn’t bother me as much as it did being forced out of my residence. “She’s getting married again so I guess it just slipped her mind that I might have trouble finding a new place.”

“I’m sure my father mentioned that we own a complex downtown.” He seemed to be mocking me again and I wondered what joke I was missing.

“He might have but we really didn’t talk about things like that.” The ire that took over his face made me wish the car wasn’t moving. I wondered again if working with this man was worth the pay. His moods were a little difficult to put up with and this was only my first real day in his employment.

“I’m sure he had much better things to discuss.” With a cool gaze at me he rolled down the drivers’ partition. “A change of plans take us to the condos.” Turning back to me he glared. “I’m sure this property will be to your liking.”

“Mr. Ross I appreciate the offer, but I don’t think I can afford a condo.” This man was a complete contradiction. One moment he was looking at me with daggers in his eyes, the next he was trying to help me out. I was more than a little confused.

“Affording isn’t an issue. I need you at my beck and call, not to mentioning knowing that you’re in a good location will make you more efficient in serving my needs. Consider it a job perk.”

I sat back in my seat trying to understand this complex persona of his. Maybe in his world this was how things worked, but in mine a boss didn’t offer to hook you up with a place to live. I was still in shock as we arrived at the ten story building.

I knew little about the property besides the fact that it was considered one of top places to live according to a local magazine. I was sure that even with my new salary my budget couldn’t afford the rent.

“Seriously? I think this place is out of my price range.” I wasn’t sure how to make him understand that people that lived in the normal world didn’t just go out and rent condos.

“I’ve already explained that this is a job perk. I use the top floor for my residence during the week and I have three vacant rentals available.” He seemed exasperated that he needed to explain this fact and I didn’t know how to make him understand I didn’t feel comfortable with this.

He urged me out of the car and quickly made his way inside. I followed him to the elevator still trying to decide how to explain my reservations. Stepping out on the ninth floor, we arrived at a door. He unlocked it and began giving me a tour. The place was unbelievable.

The living room was completely furnished in beige and cream décor and a huge suede couch and recliner took up most of the room. A large screened television rested on the wall along with surrounding artwork that teased the senses.

The kitchen was stylish and boasted of an island counter and stainless steel appliances. It was an amateur chef’s dream and that was something I considered myself as since I loved to cook. By the time I’d been shown the bedroom I was already in love with the coziness.

“I really can’t afford this.” I was smiling even as I spoke the words because the place was truly amazing.

“And as I said its part of the job perks. You only need to cover the utilities.”

How was I supposed to turn down his offer? Living in this place would be like a dream came true and the money I didn’t need to spend on rent could be put back for my education. “What if you fire me?” The thought suddenly filled my mind and brought me out of the dreaminess of how easy this all seemed.

“If things don’t work out for you then we’ll sit down and discuss another arrangement. Regardless, I’d give you at least ninety days to find something else. I believe that’s only appropriate.”

“This is really generous.” I couldn’t stop from looking around. Part of me wanted to throw caution to the wind and stop worrying because I really was enamored with my surroundings. There was still a little voice in the back of my mind that said none of this seemed realistic.

“I’ll give you the rest of the week to move in and we can work on your job presentation on your off nights.”

That comment sent up all kinds of red flags until I remembered he’d said on more than one occasion he wasn’t interested in me outside of a professional relationship. Call me stupid but I nodded my head. Worst case scenario in my mind was in a few months I’d have to look for another apartment.

He lifted a set of keys. Without hesitation he removed one and handed it to me. “All the utilities are paid up until the end of the month. You will have a payday before they come up again but let me know if there’s anything you can’t handle.”

“Thank you Mr. Ross, I can’t tell you how excited I am to move in here.” I was ecstatic. In two weeks my life had went from desperation to finally feeling like I was making progress. The worry that had been eating away at me for the first time was fading away.





chapter Four





The Move


Moving into my new condo was an experience unlike any other. Ashley, my best friend who worked at the coffee shop with me, hadn’t stopped talking about how lucky I was since we started carrying boxes in. Between her boyfriend Jimmy, and the two of us, we had what little I was bringing into the new place upstairs in a few hours.

“I’m glad you found a place to stay. If the dorms allowed roommates you know I’d have asked you to move in.” Ashley put down the last of the cardboard carriers before plopping down on the couch.

“Maybe by next year I’ll be joining you on campus. This place is really great though.” I sat down with her and Jimmy flopped down on the adjoining chair.

“I don’t know why you’d want to leave this place and move into the dorms. There’s no space at all and guests have to leave by ten.” Jimmy popped the top on a can of soda and made himself comfortable.

“You’re just pissed because you can’t spend the night with me.” Ashley grinned and grabbed the can from his hand taking a sip.

I watched their playful banter and grinned. “Trust me I’d rather be with you guys there. This job may just be my ticket to making that dream a reality.”

The doorbell rang and I quickly stood up and walked the few feet to answer it. A delivery man stood there impatiently. I hadn’t ordered anything and his arms seemed loaded down with food. “I’m sorry but I think you have the wrong place.”

“Are you Laura Burns?” He gave a tired sigh and glanced down at the receipt then up at me again.

“That’s me, but I didn’t order anything.”

“If you’ll let me in I can sit this stuff down. There’s a note included with the order.” He rolled his eyes and shifted from foot to foot, reminding me that his arms were full.

Opening the door I let him walk in and motioned to the island bar in the kitchen. He placed the food down and I felt my stomach rumble at the enticing scents filling the room. I’d never ordered from the place before so I had no idea what they served.

The disgruntled delivery guy handed me the note and turned to quickly walk out the door. “Just a minute!”

I tried to stop him but he seemed determined to leave. Shaking my head at his rudeness, I unfolded the note and gaped at the words. “I wasn’t sure what you liked so I ordered a few different items. I hope you enjoy your new home.” It was signed simply, “Taylor Ross.”

“Damn! The guys feeding you too? Is there something you’re not telling me?” Ashley grabbed the note out of my hand and looked at me accusingly.

I laughed out loud at her assumption. Yeah, cause I could be doing something with a man like him. I guess the rich and famous do housewarming stuff.” With a shrug I started unpacking the bags of food.

This definitely wasn’t Chinese. Opening the platters of steak, shrimp, and other various entrées, I almost drooled. There was even a bottle of wine and I snickered. I wasn’t old enough to drink yet.

“Hell this Ross guy sounds pretty cool.” Jimmy took the bottle of wine and unscrewed the top. Thankfully it didn’t have a cork because I didn’t own a corkscrew. He took a deep gulp straight from the bottle and Ashley and I both groaned.

“There are these things called cups.” Punching him playfully in the arm, Ashley glared at him.

“Hello! Nothing’s been unpacked yet.” He took another drink, and handed the bottle over to me.

I wiped the top off with my sleeve before taking a tentative sip. Ashley and I had snuck our share of alcohol before but four dollar wine didn’t compare to whatever red liquid this was. I was used to overly sweet, cheap stuff and this was almost bitter. “I think I’ll stick with pop.”

Ashley grabbed the bottle and took a sip. “It’s definitely fancy, but not bad. We started dishing food out on the paper plates included and dug in. The wine might be crap but the mouthwatering temptation of the steak was definitely better than what we picked up at the supermarket. Since I didn’t have to worry about rent, I’d used a little of my savings to fully load up the kitchen.

While we stuffed our faces, Ashley grilled me about my new boss. I explained that I was still learning about the company but enjoyed some of the cool perks like the clothing allowance. As far as describing him, I left it at he was an attractive man.

“Holy hell girl you get clothes and an apartment with this gig? I’m working for the wrong people.”

“For the most part I feel completely out of my league. Not to mention that he hired me as some trophy for his arm at parties. I mean honestly can you see me fitting in with high society?” I took another bite of the delicious fare and almost moaned in appreciation.

“You don’t give yourself enough credit. You’re gorgeous, smart and treat everyone around you with respect. I bet you could teach those snobs a few things.”

Jimmy chimed in with agreement. “If I wasn’t head over heels in love with Ashley I’d be pounding down your front door.”

Blushing at their compliments I shook my head. “I have no idea how to relate to Mr. Ross. If the rest of his clients are anything like him, I’m pretty much screwed.”

“See that’s what you need to work on. You’ve got no self-confidence. He obviously finds you attractive or he wouldn’t ask you to do the job. Just give them that smile of yours and his people will be tripping over their feet to make you happy.” Ashley continued indulging in her meal like it was the last one she’d ever eat.

I knew arguing with her was pointless, so we continued eating and chatted about our week. By the time we finished lunch I felt like I needed to run for a few hours to burn off all the calories. Ashley had night classes so after clean-up she and Jimmy left me alone in my new place.

The boxes were calling to me even though I was so full I wanted to take a nap. I decided to unpack and then give in to that temptation. Since the condo was furnished all I really had was my personal items and what my mother had left for me in the kitchen of our old house.

I couldn’t believe this was really my home now. Whatever good luck had come my way, I was thankful for it. I finished with the work then took a quick shower. My new bed was screaming for me to try it out and I decided to give in.

Ashley and I had stayed up late last night packing and after our early morning start I was truly exhausted. When my head found the pillow I was out in less than five minutes. I don’t know if it was all the work of moving in or my nervousness about starting full time with Mr. Ross in a few days, but my dream was interesting.

Resting in a lounge chair on an isolated beach I watched as he walked toward me. His chiseled abs stole my breath away and the carefree smile on his face made me ache. Holding out a tropical drink he lowered to his knees in the sand and lifted it to my lips.

My heart raced as I sipped the fruity concoction then nearly stopped when he replaced the glass with his lips. Lifting my arms, I wrapped them around his neck enjoying the taste of him. My nipples stiffened painfully through the thin fabric of my bathing suit. Rubbing them against his hard chest, I continued to devour his flavor as our tongues dueled. His large hand moved the top of my bikini over and cupped the aching weight of my breast. Gasping at the pleasure, I arched upward wanting to feel more of the delight his touch gave.

My belly clenched as his lips moved over my ribs, then lower and I held my breath as his tongue traced the outline of my bikini bottom. Straining my hips toward his fingers I cried out softly as those long digits slipped underneath the fabric to caress my silken folds.

He lifted his head and stared into my eyes with a mocking salute. “Such a pretty little whore you are.”

I awoke gasping for breath, his words playing through my mind like a symphony. Trembling as my body ached, I was embarrassed at the wetness between my thighs. Clenching them tightly together I forced myself to remember that it was just a dream but still I felt the tremors of unanswered desire coursing through me.

His cold words resonated through my thoughts and the strange need retreated. Since I’d never slept with a man before, being called a whore was pretty much laughable. I knew being angry with him over something as stupid as a dream was childish. But caught between the half world of sleeping and wakefulness I couldn’t help what I was feeling.

I forced myself out of the bed and tried to remember that he hadn’t really spoken those words. Maybe subconsciously I was doubting myself for taking this crazy job he lined up for me. The truth was I had no idea how to portray the character he seemed to require and I was stressed out.

If standing around and smiling was all he needed then maybe I’d be able to pull this off. Something told me that wasn’t exactly what he was looking for though. Maybe it was just the dream that had me rattled. Convincing myself that was probably it, I tried to force the negative feelings away.





chapter Five





Training


Mr. Ross wasn’t at home when I tried to thank him for the meal and the week he allotted me for moving in quickly passed. I was shocked when he appeared at my door. I assumed I would see him until I returned to the office in the morning. Without thought, I invited him in and the moment he walked through the door he filled the place with his presence.

“I trust everything went smoothly with the move.” His eyes took in everything before turning to look at me again.

He was dressed in a white button down, rolled up to the elbows, and dress pants. The man had the ability to pull off this corporate casual look with an appeal that would make a magazine proud. “I had a little help, but yes everything went great. Thank you for lunch by the way, it was delicious.” I was so nervous with him here my eyes rested on the hardwood floors.

“I’m glad you enjoyed it. I’d like to invite you up to my place so we can discuss our schedule next week.” His tone was polite but impersonal.

I nodded. The thought of invading his personal space might have left me worried if he hadn’t been showing such a nonchalant attitude.

“Something else we need to work on.” A small grin found his beautiful features as I forced my eyes up. “You should really learn to speak your responses it helps clarify that you’re in agreement.”

What was I supposed to say to that? He was my boss, if he wanted me to speak instead of giving a gesture while with him I would remember. Lowering my eyes again I found my voice. “I’ll keep that in mind.” It was almost like looking him in the eye and talking at the same time overwhelmed me, which was odd.

“I wonder?” His voice trailed off and I had to force myself to look up at him again, waiting for him to continue. “It’s not important at the moment. I’m sure you want to enjoy the rest of your evening, so let’s take care of this now.”

I followed him out the front door and into the elevator. I crossed my arms over my chest as we rode since I wasn’t wearing a bra. My self-consciousness brought back the strange dream I’d had of us or maybe it was the fact that it was chilly and my nipples were hard. I considered asking him if I could go change before we talked, but he didn’t seem to be looking my way. I could suck this up I decided.

Within moments we were standing in the hall and he was opening his front door. When I stepped inside my eyes widened. He’d told me he used the entire top floor but I wasn’t ready for the elegance that reached my eyes. Chrome and glass abounded, mixed in with dark black leather in the huge living area. While my apartment was warm and cozy his seemed to scream of refined contemporary elegance.

“Join me.” He didn’t wait for me to follow, instead he walked down a small flight of steps and sat on a huge, black leather couch.

The glass and chrome table had several manila folders placed on it and he reached down to pick them up. Not wanting to doddle, I quickly moved to sit on the far end of the furniture and waited for him to speak.

“You’ll have a hard time looking over the information I have from over there.” The smirk on his face told me he found the space I put between us amusing.

Chastened I moved closer, still leaving breathing room between us. He opened up the first folder and began reciting information about a company he was attempting to acquire. Most of what he was saying went over my head and I sat quietly allowing him to speak.

“What Mr. Morale’s business involves is really irrelevant to you, but I will need you to win his confidence.” He pointed down at the older gentleman’s photo and I studied his features.

If I had to guess, I’d gauge his age to be mid-fifties. He looked like a hard nut to crack with the stony features and coolness radiating from his almost black eyes. “Um how do you expect me to do that?” The man didn’t seem the type to do idle chit chat, and even if he did I had no idea what to talk about.

“You’re a woman. Use the talents given your gender.” He chuckled softly at his own remark and I stared at him wide-eyed.

“You want me to flirt with him?” Outside of wanting to slap his face for the suggestion, I had no freaking clue how to seduce anyone.

“Just let him know that you find him attractive and he’ll be so concerned with you I can handle the other aspects easily.”

“You’ve got supreme confidence in me if you think I have any idea on how to make that guy think I’m attracted to him.” Was he for real? What was I supposed to do whisper sweet nothings in his ear?

“Miss Burns you’re a very attractive woman, certainly you’ve used your charms to appeal to the opposite sex before.”

His eyes rudely moved over my body and I remembered I’d dropped my hands to my side. Pulling my arms back over my chest I glared.

“Contrary to popular belief Mr. Ross, girls aren’t trained from birth to seduce a man.” My face was bright red as anger and embarrassment overwhelmed me.

He rolled his eyes and stood up. “Something tells me it’s an instinctive gift in your gender. But let’s see how you do with a little practice. Stand up.”

I’d understood that he hired me to be his visual side-kick, but chauvinistic pig came to mind. With an exasperated sigh I stood and scowled at him.

“That look definitely doesn’t make me want to sell a million dollar company. Imagine you’re standing in a room with a man you desire and want to catch his eye.”

I was standing in the room with a handsome man at the moment but I all I really wanted to do was kick him in the shins. “This is nuts. Acting isn’t a skill I’ve had much practice with.”

“It’s more about body language than words. First relax and stop looking like you want to throw me out the window.” I attempted a few deep breaths dropping my arms while trying to appease him. “That’s good. Now I’m going to walk over to the other side of the room and stand and I want you to pretend that you find me appealing.”

I watched him move in front of the large stone fireplace and rest his arm on the mantle. I had no freaking idea how to look at him like he was someone I wanted to date and bit my lip nervously.

“That’s perfect. You’ve got beautiful lips, and that little expression would be enough to turn on most men.”

Did he just say I had great lips? What the hell. I was almost flattered by the compliment and deserved a meeting with a shrink over that. Trying to get my thoughts in order I lowered my eyes to the ground counting to three before I returned my gaze to his face again.

The look of stark desire in his eyes made my knees tremble and my mouth parted slightly in awe. My nipples pebbled and it had nothing to do with the air temperature. Without conscious thought I allowed my tongue to dart out and wet the dryness that suddenly accumulated on my lips. He started walking toward me and my heart fell into my stomach.

The predatory gaze made my breasts feel heavier and frightened me enough to force me back a few steps. Whatever mojo this man had going, it scared the crap out of me and I felt like running.

“What happened? You were great until I made a move toward you?” His confusion was easy to read and I felt embarrassed again.

“You made me nervous.” I cursed my honest streak because the last thing I wanted him to know was how attractive I found him.

Throwing back his thick head of hair, he chuckled. “Imposing my will on others is how I helped this company make millions, but rest assured you have no reason to be nervous around me. Unless of course you find me irresistible?” His smirk was back in place and it was apparent that he felt most women did.

I wasn’t about to admit that I was one of them. The man had enough ego for five men. “That’s not it at all, you don’t interest me in the least!” I didn’t mean to speak the words so strongly but I couldn’t take the chance that he’d see through my lies.

“Are you certain?” He raised an eyebrow, then lowered his eyes to my chest. “I don’t do relationships but a consensual enjoyment of pleasures wouldn’t be against my rules.”

Had he just offered to please me? Holy crap. I needed to run from this room and go hide somewhere. “You’re not my type.” Where those words came from I had no idea. My mind was running on self-defense mode and he was throwing up all kinds of warnings with his teasing.

“Something tells me I could be exactly what you need, but let’s get back to work.” His teasing banter slipped into seriousness in a blink of an eye and I could only assume he’d been amusing himself.

I stood absolutely still and watched him walk back to the fireplace. My heart was beating rapidly and all I wanted was to return to the safety of my own apartment.

“Let’s try this again and don’t back away when I walk toward you. Instead try offering a smile, encouraging me to join you.”

I doubted my legs would work so his demand was pretty much pointless. Even my lips were trembling as he invaded my space again. I forced myself to smile when he was only a few inches before me and almost hyperventilated when he leaned in to whisper in my ear.

“You look lovely this evening.” Chills moved down my arms at the warmth of his breath against the lobe. I couldn’t stop the involuntary shiver.

“This is where you would tell me thank you.” The amusement in his voice snapped me out of my mental fantasy, which was pretty hot at the moment if I was being honest.

“Thank you.” I whispered the words softly and met his eyes as they found mine.

I was shocked when his fingers lightly caressed my arm and gasped at the tingle left in their wake. I wanted to step back again but I felt like I was held to the spot by some invisible magnetic force.

“Would you like to walk out on the balcony to get a breath of fresh air?” The timbre of his voice was so deeply seductive I almost moaned. Fresh air would definitely be a relief to this closeness with him that seemed to be warning me of the danger he could do to my soul.

“I think that’s a good idea.” My voice was husky and I had no idea why I suddenly felt like my body was on fire.

He opened the door to his balcony and rested his hand on my lower back, guiding. The coolness of the winter air was a welcome relief as I stared over the city below. My heart was still racing as he stood behind me, the warmth of his body penetrating through the thinness of the long sleeved t-shirt I was wearing.

“A beautiful woman sharing an incredible view, I do believe this will be a night to remember.” The seductive quality in his voice was almost hypnotizing and I couldn’t stop myself from turning to face him.

I lifted my face without conscious thought and offered him my lips. I didn’t know what was wrong with me but at the moment all I wanted was to surrender to his kiss.

He lowered his head and stopped scant inches from my lips. “Now that Miss Burns, is a perfect example of seduction.” With a smirk he lifted his head and walked back into the living room.

I gripped the railing tightly for a few moments needing to gain some control over my emotions. This was nothing but a lesson to him and for reasons I didn’t care to contemplate my feelings were hurt. Taking several deep breaths I forced myself to walk back in and join him.

“I don’t think you’ll have any problems with this job.” The tick in his strong jaw made him appear angry and I had no idea why he was mad when I was the one who’d almost given in to the illusion.

“Maybe I wasn’t pretending.” I could have slapped myself for uttering those words. He made me feel inferior and I hated it. I should have told him that all the money in the world wouldn’t make me kiss an ass like him.

“Be careful what you say. I don’t think you’re ready to play in my world little girl.”

The man was an egomaniac. He deserved to be taken down a notch or two and I was just angry enough to do it. “Maybe it’s you who should be careful. Looks are sometimes deceiving.” All I can say is the devil made me do it. His high and mighty look pissed me off and I didn’t want him to see me as this child who couldn’t hold her own.

“I don’t doubt that at all. So you think you can match my skills? Be very careful how you answer because I don’t take challenges lightly.”

Pompous ass. He might be rich, handsome and successful but I’d never backed down from any challenge. Growing up with a mother like mine I’d learned to fight for anything I wanted in this life. “You just might find you’ve met your match.” I wasn’t even sure what we were talking about any longer. I only knew he’d gotten to me and I hated him for it.

He walked with aggressive movements until we were standing toe to toe again. I was completely unprepared as his hand tangled in my hair, pulling my neck back almost painfully. “This is one game you won’t win.” His lips crushed into mine and the kiss he gave was meant to punish.

Never in my life had a man treated me this way and the gasp that escaped left him the opening he needed to strike with his tongue. I don’t know when the rage turned into passion but our tongues dueled frantically until I wasn’t sure I’d be able to stand on my own.

That kiss seemed to last forever and I wasn’t sure how much further it would have gone if I hadn’t let a whimper escape. My mind was completely muddled with the taste of him driving me to insanity. His flavor was unbelievable and all I could ask for was more.

He pulled away and I almost lost my balance with the abrupt movement. “We leave for New York tomorrow. I expect you to be ready by noon.” Without any further explanation, he walked over to the front door and held it open.

I felt like I’d been slapped in the face, the change was so fast. My lips were throbbing with the pressure of his earlier seduction, and my cheek burned with the friction from his five o’clock shadow. Mindless, I walked out and raced toward the elevator.

Whatever game we were playing had been taken to a new level and I had no idea how to keep up. All I wanted was to get as far away from him as possible and hopefully clear my head. I waited impatiently to reach my floor and when I finally arrived my feet carried me inside swiftly.

I stood in my kitchen gripping the counter of the island bar trying to make sense of how wrong this night had ended. In over my head was an understatement. A man like Taylor Ross could break me without trying and I knew I’d be forced to fold my hand.

I should resign and walk away from this before I lost more than my pride. The unfairness of the situation made me want to weep, but I’d be damned if I’d allow him to bring me to that level. I wasn’t even sure what the game was any longer.

It was times like this I wished I had a mother to talk to. Picking up the phone I called Ashley, she was the only friend I had that I’d discuss something as serious as this with. Explaining what had happened tonight, my stomach fluttered. Taylor Ross was the big leagues and I still felt like I was in high school when it came to my experiences on the emotional side.

“Holy Shit! He kissed you?” Ashley gasped into the receiver. “I’ve seen pictures of your boss online, I would so be tapping that!” Obviously she wasn’t getting the magnitude of the world of crap I was suddenly floating in. “Did you like it?”

“That’s not the point!” Hell yes I liked it. Kissing Taylor was way different than those awkward fumbling’s with some boy after a date. I’d never been in a serious relationship and outside of David Miller trying to feel me up after prom my experience was pretty much nil.

“I’d say that’s pretty much everything. He’s sexy, rich and from what you’ve told me exciting as hell.”

This conversation was not helping. “He’s my boss and something tells me fun with him might leave me shattered.”

“You’re twenty maybe a little shattering is just what you need at the moment. Seriously I don’t know why you’re holding on to the V card. If you want him, then I say go for it. I mean you did say he wasn’t into relationships, right?”

“Consensual enjoyment of pleasures,” I repeated Ross’s earlier statement verbatim. “What the hell does that even mean?”

“Sounds to me like the guy just wants some no commitment sex. That leaves you with two choices. File a charge of sexual harassment on him, or have a little fun.” Ashely was laughing and it was apparent she didn’t see the big deal.

“I need this job.” Not to mention the cushy living arrangements weren’t something I wanted to give up. “If I slept with him I’d feel like a whore.” That was the gist of the situation. I did find Taylor attractive but at the same time I didn’t have a clue how to deal with him. I mean what could a person like me offer?

“I don’t think you fit the definition of the word.” Ashley giggled and the sound was grating on my nerves. “Seriously either do him or don’t. From what little I’ve read about him online he has some huge reputation in the business world. He’s not going to risk you actually filing charges against him if you turn him down.”

She was right. I didn’t see Mr. Ross being the type of man who’d force me to do anything. I’d been the one who refused to back down because of my own pride. Maybe I was just making more out of this than needed to be. Taking a deep breath I allowed some of my anxiety to ease.

“You’re right. I guess I just freaked out because I never expected him to kiss me.” Maybe the truth was more along the lines of me not expecting to enjoy that kiss as much as I had too.

“Well there you go. If it were me I’d just go about my job like nothing happened. Unless you want him, then I’d say take him up on the challenge.” She yawned into the receiver.

“I’ll let you get some sleep. We’re going to New York tomorrow for a business trip. I’ll call you when I get back.”

“Damn I wish I had your job! If you need me just give me a call.”

“Love you. Get some sleep, sorry I woke you.” We hung up and I felt a little better. He probably wouldn’t even remember last night. There was no doubt in my mind he had women tripping over their feet to enjoy his pleasures and that thought helped me stop worrying about being alone with him on the trip.

Flight


After a restless night filled with dreams of my boss¸ I realized I only had a few hours before he arrived. Taking a quick shower the sleepiness evaporated and gave me enough energy to pack for our excursion. I’d never visited New York and I hoped to see some of the sights during our down time.

I packed up the overpriced clothes in the only suitcase I owned. It was a little worn and I made a mental reminder to pick up one a little more fitting before our next trip. Not sure how I was expected to dress on the plane, I’d chosen a simple pair of black dress pants, slid on the shortest of the heels, and topped it off with a silky white dress shirt. Pulling a black trench coat from my closet I carried it into the kitchen and draped it over a chair.

Having never flown before I decided on a light breakfast of cereal. The stuff was probably loaded down with sugar but it was a childhood obsession that I still hadn’t outgrown. Instead of coffee I opted for orange juice. I seriously didn’t need any caffeine this morning because despite knowing I wasn’t Mr. Ross’s type, my nerves were still a little strung about spending time alone with him.

I chalked up last night to him being bored and me overstepping the boundaries with my challenge. There was no way a man like him would want someone like me and thinking anything else was just foolish. Finishing my breakfast quickly I walked back to the bathroom to fix my hair and makeup.

The tips I’d learned from the spa yesterday paid off because when I looked back in the mirror a woman much more refined stared into my eyes. I tamed my unruly blonde curls with a hot iron and wrapped them in a bun that added a few years to my appearance. Satisfied, I brushed my teeth and then walked back into the living room to wait for him.

I wasn’t expecting his driver to show up at my door and when he took my bag I could only follow him to the elevator somewhat shocked. This wasn’t my life and I knew it was going to take some adjustment on my part to get accustomed to how things worked. Standing outside the back of the limousine I peeked in and almost gasped at the sight of Mr. Ross resting back against the cool leather talking heatedly into his phone.

“We will discuss this more when I arrive tonight. Just make sure that you aren’t late for the meeting.”

His deep blue eyes looked over me with a coolness that did little for my nervousness. “I would like to leave sometime today Miss Burns.”

I didn’t even realize I hadn’t entered the car and I hastily slid in, buckling my seat belt. The driver shut my door and within moments the car was moving forward. I didn’t turn my gaze to him, instead I folded my hands demurely in my lap and glanced out the window as the scenery moved by.

My heart was racing in my chest and I took several deep breaths to calm myself. I heard him chatting away again but his tone seemed more relaxed now. Just the sound of his voice was enough to make me feel things I shouldn’t and without thought I crossed my legs in attempt to thwart the strange sensations.

“You seem very uncomfortable, Miss Burns.” The mocking undertone of his sensual voice forced my eyes to his. I knew I shouldn’t have looked his way. The heat he was radiating from those dangerously blue depths made my mouth dry.

“It’s my first real challenge as your assistant.” I hoped he bought that I was nervous about doing a good job for him and not the real reason for my anxiety.

“Which challenge are you referring to?” A smirk lifted his full lips and I almost stopped breathing.

“The job of course.” I lowered my eyes to my lap flustered at his words. Uncomfortable didn’t begin to define the way I felt being alone in this car with him. It didn’t help that the subtle fragrance of his aftershave was bathing me in its aroma and doing little to help me remember he was my boss.

“I do believe the job will come easily for you. You demonstrated your skills very well last night.” I bit my lip wishing I could open my mouth and tell him that I didn’t mean to challenge him at all. Clenching my hands tightly together, I forced my eyes to return to the passing view.

His soft chuckle reverberated through my body in ways that should be against the law. I tensed and inched over until I was pressed against the door. He was obviously much better at playing games than I was and it terrified me that I was actually turned on by this little cat and mouse game.

“You could always forfeit.” The arrogance in his tone was my undoing. Without thinking it through I turned to glare at him.

“Perhaps you should. I’ve never lost a bet Mr. Ross and better men than you have tried and failed.” What the hell was I saying? The words just flew out of my mouth like some demon was possessing me.

“So we’re betting now. What wager should we throw down?” His deep laugh even filled his eyes and I knew I was in a world of trouble.

Me and my big mouth. This wasn’t the first time I’d put my foot in it. Growing up fighting for the smallest of reprieves with my own mother, my first defense mechanism was to never back down. “I’ll let you decide your own doom.”

“Confident are we?” He tapped a long digit against his chin, seeming to contemplate the stakes. “Give me a moment, I’m sure to find something that will be worthy of such an opponent.”

The egomaniac was laughing at me and even though I knew he’d probably smash me like a bug, I couldn’t give an inch. “You do that Mr. Ross, but just remember I don’t like losing.”

I was so screwed. And not just a little bit, but like driving myself off a cliff and landing on jagged rocks, car explosion screwed. Glancing at his face I felt I could see the devious thoughts moving through his mind. This man had a world of experience under his belt, I didn’t doubt, and I was like some little girl who still needed training wheels on her bike.

“Let’s make this interesting shall we?” The smirk was back and I really wanted to slap it off his face. “You convince Mr. Morale’s to sell his company to me without sleeping with him in the process, and you win. If you don’t then you please me in whatever way I choose for one night.”

My jaw dropped open at his suggestion and I wanted to tell him to take his bet and stick it so far up his backside that he limped. “I’m not screwing you for a bet.” What kind of man would even make that kind of wager in the first place?”

If anything his smirk grew more defined. “I don’t think I mentioned screwing you Miss Burns. I said please me and I’m sure a women with your looks understands that doesn’t necessarily involve fucking.”

My face heated at his words as I tried to digest what he was saying. Even with my limited experience of the work place I knew that what he was offering was illegal. Maybe I should have filed charges of sexual harassment against him. If the thought of pleasing him didn’t turn me on so much I might have considered it then.

“Fine. You’re going to lose but just so we’re clear I am not having sex with you. When I win, and I will, you give a five thousand dollar donation to my college fund.” I had lost my ever loving mind. I had no idea how I was supposed to convince his client. Not to mention the fact that if I lost it didn’t matter how handsome I found Mr. Ross. The idea of pleasing him wasn’t even something I understood how to do.

His answering smirk and curt nod made my heart race. There was no way I could lose this bet. It didn’t matter that I was clueless somehow I would find a way to convince Mr. Morale’s into selling, because pleasing Mr. Ross might very well be my own undoing.

The limousine had stopped and my door was being held open. How I managed not to trip over my own feet as I exited was beyond me. Taking in my surrounding my nervousness went up even more. I’d assumed we were flying on a commercial airline, instead I was faced with a small private jet with the stairs already unfolded and ready to board. Ross Industries stood out in bright blue letters on the side of the plane.

“We’re flying in that?” My voice cracked and the earlier wager was forgotten momentarily. I didn’t know much about jets, or planes for that matter but surely this thing was more dangerous than the bigger ones.

“I like to be in control Miss Burns, I rarely fly the public airlines.”

Control. That didn’t surprise me in the least but risking my life for this job was not part of the deal. “Are you sure this thing will make it off the ground?” I knew I was being paranoid but the thought of being lifted into the air by such a small vessel was frightening.

“I would be offended but since I can see you’re serious, this baby is one of the safest ways to fly.”

“Fine. But if die on this thing I’m holding you personally responsible.” Forcing my feet to walk toward the boarding stairs I heard his laugher and all I could do was grit my teeth as I walked into the steel trap of death.

By the time he joins me I’m strapped into the surprisingly comfortable seat and gripping the arm rests for dear life. A couch sat across from me but I couldn’t help but feel that the seat was safer. I didn’t expect the opulence in the cabin and it helped a little to make the small place seem less claustrophobic.

“Is it all planes that terrify you Miss Burns or just jets?” He walked over and sat causally on the couch and I kept my focus straight ahead.

“I’ve never actually flown before so I can’t say.” The thought of hurling on the fancy interior of this thing is the only reason I haven’t done it. I just want this ride over and done with.

He stands to move around the cabin, and I close my eyes focusing on my breathing. Coming back a few minutes later I feel his knee brush against mine and tense.

“Drink this Laura, I think it will help you relax.”

It’s the first time he’s used my given name and I open my eyes to gawk up at him. Taking the glass from him, my hands tremble threatening to spill the golden contents.

“Fuck. Let me help you.” He takes back the glass and holds it to my lips.

Shocked, my mouth opens and the strong liquor burns my tongue as he tilts the glass. I swallow and start coughing much to his obvious amusement.

“You’re not much of a drinker I see.” His eyes crinkle at the sides and I’m shocked by how attractive it makes him look. As if he needed any more help in that department.

My sarcasm defense rears its head as I reply with a glare. “I’m not old enough to drink.”

“Add it to my list of crimes.” He laughs at me handing over the glass.

Joking Taylor is not something I’m prepared for because my insides quiver seeing the brilliant smile on his already too handsome face. Without thinking I tilt the glass back and almost choke again. It takes me a minute to realize I wasn’t thinking of him as Mr. Ross at that moment and I’m sure that’s another dangerous move toward my own defeat. I down the rest of the liquor not giving myself time to think.

“Mr. Ross our checks are complete. If you’re ready to depart sir, we can leave now.”

The pilot doesn’t look much older than Taylor and I clench my eyes together again tightly. I was going to die on this thing. Yep no doubt about it.

“The sooner the better.” His tone with the pilot is abrupt and I wonder if he’s always in a grumpy mood. Then I remember his earlier amusement at my expense. There is a sense of humor but perhaps it’s only when it brings embarrassment to others.

The liquor finally hits me and I feel some of my tension ease along with a rush that has my head swaying to the side. I hear Taylor curse under his breath and then he shocks the hell out of me by lifting me into his arms and carrying me over to the couch.

The plane begins to move and he quickly moves to put me down. Losing his balance he grips the armrest with one hand while the other moves to the opposite side of my body resting on the top of the leather cushion. His closeness drives the thought of taking off into the sky to the back of my mind and a soft moan leaves my lips. I inhale the masculine scent of him and for a moment I’m lost.

“Distraction works too.” His words don’t resonate in my mind until I feel his lips press against my own. Suddenly I’m starving for affection and my tongue darts into his mouth and his flavor envelops my senses. He tastes of mint toothpaste, combined with a hint of coffee and some other tantalizing flavor that I can only categorize as Taylor.

My head spins as he ravages my mouth and there’s nothing but this moment. Whimpering, my hands tangle in his thick hair and my body strains upward aching to feel his chest against me. The nervousness and effects of the alcohol are forgotten as his strong hands grasp my wrists pulling them from his hair and pressing them against the inner wall of the plane.

His knee parts my legs and I gasp as it pushes into the seat then against my core. The sensation is so heady my hips strain forward, aching for the contact. He breaks our kiss and his teeth bite down gently on my lower lip, tugging softly before releasing.

“Already conceding defeat little girl?” His grip on my hands is almost painful as they press more firmly into the wall and it takes a moment for his words to register.

Staring up into his cool gaze I tremble and try to make sense of the question. When it hits me I struggle to release my hands but he holds them firm, showing me just how powerful he truly is. It’s then that I feel his very large arousal against my stomach and my sense of self-preservations kicks into overdrive. “You might need to think about a cold shower since the only thing I’ve proven is you want me.

His eyes shoot daggers at me but my hands are released. Forcing myself not to rub them to regain circulation, I return the glare. I have no idea how I managed to be such a bitch but the result works because he moves to the chair he’d pulled me from only moments earlier.

“Game on.” Whatever small victory I’ve won is lost by his comments and I know I’m in over my head and could easily drown.

The thought of him being hard for me was heady but even a woman without sexual experience knew a guy could get it up if the wind blew the right way. If anything my words had given him more reason to play dirty. My subconscious told me I’d just screwed myself royally.

The rest of the flight is spent worrying more about how I’m going to win this bet than the fear of plummeting to my death. My legs clench tightly together trying to ignore the ache throbbing between them. The thought of pleasing Taylor for a night suddenly wasn’t the most horrible idea in the world. I knew that was my libido talking and not my common sense. I wanted this man to the point that it terrified me.

We touched down in New York and the fear of my demise was the last thing on my mind. Death on that plane might have been easier than whatever devious scheme Taylor could contrive and the tick in his jaw told me that he was definitely plotting. Sexy as hell or not, I had to fight this overwhelming attraction I felt for him.





chapter Six





New York


A new driver picked us up at the airport and Taylor didn’t speak to me as we were driven to our hotel. My eyes widened in wonder as I stepped out and glanced up at the at least twenty story high building. The thought of spending the weekend here trumped all the worry about the earlier events as I allowed my excitement to overwhelm me.

I was brought back to earth as Taylor’s hand rested on my back encouraging me to move forward. The automatic doors we passed through were like a ticket to an amusement park and I took in the extravagance surrounding me like a child.

When my eyes finally found his again I was stunned by the confusion on that beautiful face. As soon as the expression came it had passed, and the tell-tale tick returned to his strong jaw. I guessed he was still angry that I’d managed to outwit him in the plane. For reasons I didn’t care to contemplate my ego was flattered.

The front desk personnel were almost overly efficient as they seemed to trip over themselves to accommodate him. Obviously he didn’t just command my attention. In five minutes we were walking toward the elevators and on the way up to our rooms.

Or room I would find out as we reached the penthouse floor. The incredible view of the Hudson mesmerized me and I walked over to the glass that lined from floor to ceiling to stare at it in awe. “It’s breathtaking.”

“Let me show you to your room.” I didn’t want to see my room at the moment, I wanted to stare at the vision. I also didn’t want to argue with him so I turned my gaze away and followed petulantly. It was hard to be angry when I was led into a new paradise.

The bedroom had an incredible view of the Hudson as well and the massive bed with a dark red, leather headboard seemed to take up most of the room. This place was like something out of a fairytale. It took a moment for my brain to kick in.

“Um where are you sleeping?” I’d seen the living room and dining area briefly as we walked through the doors and I knew this was too big for one person.

“Down the hall.” That familiar smirk was back on his face and I bit my lip.

“Maybe I should have my own room.” There was no maybe about it. Even if this suite was huge there had to be some written rule about boss and employee staying in the same place?”

“Worried you won’t be able to stay out of my bed?” The smirk deepened and I felt the color rise in my cheeks.

“Actually I’m worried you might forget which bed is yours.” My bitchiness was born of stark terror that he might be right

“I own this suite Miss Burns. If you’re too afraid to share it with me I’m sure that we can reserve you a room on one of the floors below.” There it was. Another challenge.

The realistic part of myself wanted to seek out that place far away from him, but the part that refused to back down took the lead. “As long as you don’t think this is anything but business I guess this will do.”

“Until you lose our bet I agree to those terms. But when you do lose, I’d suggest you embrace your inner whore.” He turned and walked out of the room leaving me staring at his way too attractive backside.

My inner what? The dream came back full force and his words slapped me in the face. Such a pretty little whore. Was that really how he saw me? Mortified, I sat down on the bed attempting to catch my breath.

Maybe my subconscious had seen through the reality of how he felt about me, but it made no sense. I’d done nothing to give him the impression I was easy. Or perhaps unwittingly I had with repudiating defeat over his challenges.

Refusing to allow that negative thought, I grew irate. He was the male pimp here hiring me to turn on his clients so that he could sweep in and take away their companies. How dare he think I was the type of woman that screwed a man to get what I wanted! He wanted a whore? He was going to get more than he ever bargained for tonight.

I was determined to turn the tables on him with Mr. Morale’s and win this damn bet with the devil. I’d do it with my clothes on and take that five thousand dollars toward my education and say adios. So what if I had to beg for my job at the coffee shop back and work twice as hard this year to obtain my goals.

I’d made it through worse shit than this in my life and even though my eyes filled with tears at the thought of being back to square one, I wasn’t trading respect for myself to work with an asshole like him. Swiping away a tear that escaped I put a game plan in motion. I might not be a whore but I was determined to get my due. The only screwing that would be going on tonight was with his head.

I realized I was cursing, well at least mentally. Working with him was already turning me into a person I wasn’t sure I liked. Lenny had told me once that foul language spoke negatively about a person and I’d taken those words to heart. I was usually good about using real words, even hanging around a best friend that swore like a sailor.

I needed to get away from his influence. Five thousand dollars would get me settled into a new apartment and hopefully tide me over long enough to start putting back money again. Firming my resolve I knew all I had to do was get through this weekend and I could get my life back on track. All this stuff he surrounded himself with was nice but beneath the fancy trappings I was still a better person than he could ever be.

With a plan of action in place I marched back into the living area and tried to keep my emotions hidden. He was standing at the island counter talking on the phone as I entered and his eyes roamed over me insultingly. Placing my hands on my hips, I tapped my foot impatiently waiting for him to finish his conversation.

A dark eyebrow lifted over his blue eyes and he seemed amused by my impatience. I bit my lip so stop from calling him the ass that I thought he was at the moment. After what seemed like an eternity he finally ended his call. “Is there something I can help you with Miss Burns?”

“What time is our meeting tonight?” I gritted my teeth to stop the vile words spinning through my mind aching to be unleashed.

“Eager to begin pleasing me?” I felt like throwing a temper tantrum, but fought the need and instead smiled with confidence that I didn’t feel.

“What I’m eager to do is explore the city, but I need to know what time I need to be back.” I refused to give into his baiting and from his surprised expression it was the right choice to make.

“It would be remiss of me to allow such a beautiful young lady to be on her own in New York. I’ll accompany you.”

The thought of spending the day with him appealed and repelled me at the same time. As stupid as it was I was attracted to him and knew that after this weekend we’d never see each other again. Instead of telling him where to stick his offer I found myself reluctantly agreeing. “Fine but I get to choose where we go.” I hated the sulkiness in my tone and almost cringed.

His eyes darkened but he motioned toward the door. Pleased that I’d at least gained that small concession I didn’t waste time overthinking how bad of a decision this was. Several hours later I was shocked to discover that taking in the sights with him had not been the complete disaster I’d worried it would be.

He knew a great deal about the history of the places we visited, and I was shocked at the wonder the city had to offer. We walked through a museum, stopped by the 9/11 Memorial, and even ate a hot dog at a corner-curb vendor. This was something I would have expected with a friend like Ashley, but Taylor being so laid back was just another faction of his personality that unraveled.

“I should take you to a play while we’re here.” I was astonished that he offered even if I didn’t consider myself a lover of the stage.

“I honestly don’t consider myself a play type of person.” My idea of the arts was watching television or maybe going to a rock concert with friends. Just another difference of status thing that made me realize how far apart our tastes were.

“Have you ever been to one?” His question was strangely sincere and one of the first times he’d questioned me about something without that mocking smirk lining his face.

“Not unless you count the horrible ones at school.” I crinkled my nose. The boredom of those events was something I looked back on with great disgust.

He chuckled softly and for once he wasn’t the imposing Mr. Ross, but someone I could relate too. “If my only experience had been amateur I might find it distasteful as well. I’m not sure what’s playing at the moment, but if not this weekend, we’ll have to initiate you another time so you can appreciate the love of theater.”

I didn’t tell him that I had no intention of being with him in the future so I nodded. We visited the Statue of Liberty and I was grinning in awe as we made our way up. I caught him staring at me with this odd look in his eyes and frowned.

“What is it?” For the first time since we’d left the hotel earlier I felt uncomfortable under his scrutiny.

“I just find it refreshing how exciting you’re finding this.” He seemed confused by his own comment and shook his head.

“What’s not to be excited about? She’s a beautiful symbol of freedom and a reminder of what everyone in the world strives to have.” I shrugged and stared at the historical vision in awed wonder.

“Indeed.” His muffled response is curious, but I’m so enthralled at finally seeing this that I don’t bother dwelling on it. “We need to prepare for our meeting tonight.”

Just like that the peaceful feelings evaporate and I barely give a nod as he leads me back down to the waiting car. I was glad I got to sightsee a little today and I knew that this was probably the last time I’d get to New York for a while. My plans for the immediate future involved hard work and struggling to pay bills, but hopefully one day I’d be able to view all these places I could only dream about right now.





chapter Seven





Merger


We went our separate ways after entering the penthouse and I prepared for the biggest job of my life. I’d called Ashley earlier for advice and she’d been very unhelpful. She thought leaving a great job because I felt uncomfortable was irrational even though she promised to talk to the coffee house manager about getting my position back. Ashley and Jimmy had been a couple since ninth grade so I doubted she could understand what I was dealing with.

After a hot shower that I thought would help my nerves I found myself feeling even more anxious. Could I really play the seductress in hopes of winning this stupid bet? If I wanted that new start I would do exactly that, I told my reflection in the steamy bathroom mirror.

What I didn’t have in knowledge, I would have to make up for in appearance. I just hoped it would be enough. With that thought in mind I dried my long, blonde tresses then straightened out the almost waist length curls with a hot iron. I applied my makeup artfully thanks to the lessons from the spa, then walked into the bedroom donning the new silk thong that supposedly wouldn’t show a line in the dress I was wearing.

Sliding them over my just shaved legs, I had to admit how smooth the material felt against my skin. Pulling the dress from the closet I shook my head removing the outrageous price tag. The bright red silk shimmered in my hands and I felt it couldn’t be a more appropriate color for the feat I was attempting tonight.

I stepped into the garment and almost sighed at how it hugged my waist perfectly then slid to my ankles in soft folds. The back of the dress was non-existent and not wearing a bra was making me a little nervous. Since the front of the dress was halter type and showed off more cleavage than I thought legal, I almost changed my mind about choosing it.

Glancing into a full length mirror inside the closet I bit my lip nervously. If I wanted to seduce a man this was definitely the outfit to do it in. Inhaling deeply I made the decision to wear it. Sliding into three inch, black heels I hoped I didn’t bust my ass tonight and completely ruin the effect I hoped the dress would have.

Trying not to do just that I walked into the living room and waited for Taylor to join me. The look in his eyes was almost worth the embarrassment I felt at being so exposed.

“Miss Burns you don’t play fair.” Why the hell was he smirking at me again? When his eyes moved toward my breasts I wanted to safety-pin the all too provocative straps together that showed off entirely too much cleavage. That lingering gaze of his made me tremble and that was enough to get my head back in the game. Taking a deep breath my eyes aimed for my feet as I attempted to gain control over the heat pooling in my belly that his perusal created.

The evident arousal that met my eyes as my head lowered was shocking. Instead of embarrassing me, it gave a heady sense of power. For a moment I wondered if he stuffed his pants and then my cheeks did turn bright red. Needing to gain back some ground I allowed my smart ass mouth to come to the rescue.

“Judging from your reaction getting Mr. Morale’s to give in should be no problem.” I turned my back on him knowing I’d never be able to look him in the eye after my bold put down.

“Little girl I think I might have to increase the stakes.”

Another challenge? I was barely holding on as it was. “Just be ready to hand over five grand when this night is done.” Then all this would be over, I told myself. Why the thought left me feeling bereft I’d consider later. Much later, I thought as his arm entwined with mine leading me out of the room.

His deep, low chuckle didn’t help my nerves in the least and I still had some old man to seduce. He waited until we stepped into the elevator to speak again. Pressing the button for the ground floor he turned back with a shit-eating grin on his face. “I hope you’re ready to please me when this farce is over. I think we both know you’re longing for it.”

As if on cue my body betrayed me and I felt the dampness flood my core. Why his words turned me on so much was a mystery but one that I was damn sure unwilling to explore. Taylor Ross was dangerous to my well-being and if there was one thing I valued above all things, it was self-preservation.

We didn’t speak at all during the drive to our location and not knowing where he was taking me was almost as unnerving as sitting in such close proximity to him. The man didn’t follow any rules, instead of putting on his own seatbelt he crowded my space and pressed his thigh against mine.

Instead of calling him out on his outrageous tactics I tensed and prepared for the longest ride of my life. My body felt so tightly strung I was ready to scream by the time we pulled up in front of a high-rise similar to the one we’d just left.

The name on this building was very familiar to me and thoughts of his reality business show played through my memories. I was so far out of my league that what little confidence I did have took a nose dive and I ached to remain firmly attached to the expensive leather seat as the door was opened.

It dawned on me that Taylor was leading me into a world of power and games that were played with more money than I’d ever hope to dream about. It was a far cry from socializing with customers at the coffee shop and I doubted I would be anything but an enigma to these kinds of people. I nibbled on my lip nervously feeling an insecurity that had my head bowed.

“While your lips are lovely and I’m sure the red carpet is interesting, I do believe we have a little wager to consider.” His mocking humor pulled me out of my self-pity and filled me with a fire I wasn’t aware I possessed.

So what if these assholes had money, they probably never worked a day in their life for anything. Lifting my chin I stared ahead and pulled my shoulders back. They still got out of bed and put their clothes on the same way I did, and screw them if they didn’t think I was worthy enough to be in their company.

“Good girl.” Was that respect I heard in his voice? I didn’t have time to think about that as I was led into a room full of faces that I’d only seen before in the tabloids.

With a smile pasted on my face I nodded and spoke politely while being introduced to some of the most important people in the business world. Champagne was being handed out by uniformed servers and Taylor snagged two glasses, passing one over to me.

For a moment I worried about getting in trouble for underage drinking but then I remembered where I was. I took the glass and drank deeply, knowing I’d need the liquid courage to go through with my plans tonight. Glancing around at the beautiful women surrounding me I wasn’t sure I had a chance anymore.

Accepting defeat was not an option though, and when I recognized the face of Mr. Morale’s I knew I couldn’t back down. “Introduce me to him.” My voice sounded demanding but it was really nerves pushing me to get this deed done.

“So eager, Miss Burns.” Even Taylor’s mocking laugh wasn’t going to pull me away from my endeavor. I gave a brief nod of my head and he gave that all too familiar smirk, leading me toward my conquest.

Mr. Morales’ fit his photo to a tee and I smiled warmly as introductions were made, trying to fight off the nervousness that I felt inwardly. His moist, meaty palm clasped my hand a little too tightly and I had to mentally force myself not to recoil.

“Resorting to bribery now Mr. Ross?” Mr. Morales’ still hadn’t released my hand and the look in his sinister almond eyes made me nauseous as he stared at Taylor.

“I wouldn’t dream of that, but perhaps you and my lovely assistant would like to get better acquainted.” If I didn’t know better I would swear that Taylor was trying to help me win this bet. If that wasn’t encouragement then what was?

“I’d be delighted to get to know her better.” His stubby finger rubbed over the top of my hand and his eyes seemed to tell me that seducing him would be one of the easiest things I’d ever done. The whole situation made me feel dirty but remembering my role I batted my eyelashes at him and smiled suggestively.

“Then I’ll leave you in her more than capable hands.” Taylor spoke the words with a sensual undertone and lowered his lips to my cheek to plant a soft kiss. “Enjoy yourself.”

My cheek still burned from the impersonal gesture and I forced my eyes to Mr. Morale’s face instead of following the man that left my heart racing with such a simple gesture. “Are you enjoying your evening?” I needed to get my head back with the plan and simple conversation seemed a good place to start.

“My dear I must say that boredom was overwhelming me until this very moment.” Oh my freaking hell, the old man was flirting with me! Swallowing down the bile in my throat I grinned broadly acting as if my IQ had slipped a couple dozen places.

“You are such a flatterer. How did a man as handsome as you manage to be here all alone.” That was like putting the cheese in cheesiness but obviously Mr. Morales’ didn’t mind at all since his chubby face broke into a huge smile.

“A man in my position rarely has time to worry about his social calendar my dear. But for once I’m glad I don’t have a date. Now I have a beautiful young woman by my side.” Maybe I wasn’t giving the cheesiest lines because Mr. Morales’ seemed to be well versed in his own.

I racked my mind with conversation ideas, having no idea what a man like him would want to discuss. I decided to focus on his business. “I’m new to the world of business what exactly is it you do?” I acted as if my entire life hung on the expectation of his next words when I really wanted to pull away as his arm gripped my waist leading me around the crowded room.

For the next half hour he explained, and might I say in great detail, the background of his company. I knew more about real estate properties overseas than I’d ever cared to know but I forced myself to act as if he were the most interesting man on the planet.

Several glasses of champagne were imbibed and my head was feeling light with the sensation. Fanning my face as it heated all I could think about was taking a breath of fresh air. The room was filled with a hundred different fragrances that seemed to be overwhelming now that I’d allowed myself to drink a little too much.

“Would you mind stepping out for some air?” I glanced toward the balcony in longing hoping that a few minutes of the cool night air might clear my head.

“Nothing would please me more, my dear.” He grasped my arm almost painfully and led me toward the glass doors. The first bite of the winter chill made me tremble and I rubbed my arms over my bare arms to fight off the chill.

“Let me warm you up.” Mr. Morales’ rubbed his hands across my now chilled shoulders and I tensed at the intimacy of the act. Gasping, I turned toward him and was shocked when his lips crashed down grinding his teeth against mine.

Repulsed I stood in shocked silence for a moment until reality stepped in and I attempted to back away. Unfortunately the brick ledge blocked that attempt and I was forced to push on his thick chest.

“Stop playing hard to get my dear. If Mr. Ross is willing to let me fuck you for this deal, maybe I’ll reconsider turning him down.”

His words shocked me to the core and I managed to slip from under his meaty arms. I didn’t belong in this world. Tears filled my eyes and I raced back into the crowded room and looked around for Taylor. Seeing him in conversation with some voluptuous brunette my heart ached with some emotion I didn’t understand. I just wanted to leave this place and everything it stood for. If this was how the upper half lived then I didn’t want any part of it. Stalking over to stand in front of Taylor I gave him what he wanted.

“You win. Now can you please get me out of here?” I didn’t care that I’d lost or even what the ramifications were for losing this wager. All I knew is that if I didn’t leave this place immediately I was going to make a fool out of myself by crying like a two year old.

His concerned gaze didn’t help my emotional mood and instead of waiting for his answer I walked with what little pride I had left to the front door. Even if I had to walk back to the hotel I was escaping this madness and everything it stood for.

I was trembling from the cold and the disgusting act with Mr. Morales’ when Taylor finally caught up with me. Without a word he removed his jacket and draped it over my arms. The driver pulled up to the curb and he ushered me into the warmth of the car.

Gazing out the window as we drove off I really wasn’t seeing anything. I felt the press of a cool glass into my hands and finally tore my gaze away from the view.

“Drink that, it will help you warm up.” Was that concern in his voice? Shouldn’t he be gloating about how miserably I’d failed and cheer about claiming his prize? The fact that he didn’t made me feel even worse than I already did. Tossing back the contents of the glass I tensed as the heat filled my body.

I wanted to get so roaring drunk that I forgot everything that happened tonight and maybe even get through whatever it was he demanded without caring too. I held out the glass for more. Instead of arguing he refilled my cup and again I downed it. With the earlier effects of the champagne and the stronger liquor I’d just imbibed I suddenly didn’t care.

I’d failed tonight and the outlook for my life was looking bleaker than ever. Maybe people like me just didn’t get a break and were doomed to always come up last. Resting my head back against the leather seat I closed my eyes and decided to just not give a shit. I’d never felt so hopeless before and I honestly didn’t want to deal with the emotion.

I felt strong arms lift me up sometime later but I didn’t feel like opening my eyes. Instead I nuzzled my cheek against the warm chest I was pressed against and allowed my weariness to lull me back to sleep. Surrounded by a scent that tantalized my senses I decided if I was already screwed I might as well enjoy the moment of bliss I was being given.

That was the last thing I remembered until the bright glare of the sun piping through the windows forced me to awaken. I shivered as cool air wafted over my body and glanced down to see that I was dressed in nothing but my barely-there panties. What the hell had I done?

I replayed last night in my mind and knew that I’d gotten drunk enough to pass out but that was all I remembered. I was in my bed in the penthouse and glancing over I breathed a sigh of relief that I was alone. That lasted long enough to see the jacket Taylor had been wearing last night draped over the armchair beside my bed.

Pulling the covers up over me, I almost cried in disbelief. We obviously hadn’t made love, correction fucked because I doubted he knew the meaning of the other word. Even saying the word in my head made me blush but I had other things to worry about.

He’d undressed me because I doubted I had the ability to do that on my own as much as I’d drank. What else had he done? As if seeing me naked wasn’t enough to leave me mortified for the rest of my life. I decided I could either curl up in my bed hiding in shame, or go face the overbearing oaf and demand some answers.

Choosing the second option I slid out of the bed, walked to the bathroom to slide on a robe, then stomped out into the living room area to face him. He was sitting on the couch, sipping on a cup of coffee with just showered hair and wearing nothing but a pair of black silk boxer shorts. Forcing my eyes to his face I glared.

“What did you do to me last night?” From somewhere deep within, I found the bitchy part of my personality and tossed the accusing words at him loudly.

“Excuse me?” His blue eyes filled with ice and the stare he gave me almost made me take a step back. He wasn’t intimidating me with that look after he’d undressed me and done god knows what while I was comatose.

“I’ll excuse you when you explain why I woke up wearing nothing but my underwear you pervert!” My hands automatically moved to my hips and I gave him a look that dared him to deny what he’d done.

“Little girl I might be a pervert but raping a woman who couldn’t even remember where she was last night is not my style. Now if you’ll sit down and act like a rational adult I’ll be glad to finish this conversation with you in a calmer manner.”

He admitted to being a pervert? What the hell? I wanted to scream at him demanding answers but his calm coolness as he took another sip of coffee made me feel like a fool. Gritting my teeth I moved to opposite end of the couch knowing he was taunting me with his laid back attitude.

“What happened?” My words were just as accusing as before but I managed to tone down the volume.

He sat the coffee cup down on the table beside him, then turned to face me. “Before or after you passed out and spilled a glass of brandy down your dress?” An arched brow lifted and the familiar smirk I’d come to love and hate filled his handsome face.

I couldn’t deny passing out, even though I wanted to desperately and it wouldn’t surprise me if I had spilled my drink. “After.” My tone was somewhat calmer now because I was dealing with my own embarrassment.

“I removed your dress and put you in your bed, Miss Burns. Then if you must know I used some club soda on the dress so that it could be salvaged and I sent it down to the cleaners this morning.” He was overly amused and I knew that he thought I was assuming something much worse.

Still grumpy but more at ease I pouted. “You shouldn’t have undressed me.” It was lame considering that I’d probably smelled like a brewery, but still he’d seen me naked!

“Your breasts, while quite lovely, aren’t the first pair I’ve seen before. I was only considering your comfort.” My face heated at his words and I wondered if I was being ungrateful. No! The man had seen parts of my body no other man had visualized before.

“Next time just leave my clothes on.” Standing up I didn’t meet his eyes and walked over to the coffee service. Pouring myself a cup I heard his deep sensual laugh and it resounded in that part of my body that only he seemed to have a line too.

“Perhaps you should moderate your alcohol intake and not allow there to be a next time. Besides I do believe you owe me a night of pleasure Miss Burns and I expect to see much more than I uncovered last night.”

“You’re not seriously expecting me to honor that bet?” My heart fell into my stomach and I almost dropped my drink. I was so screwed right now because I couldn’t just walk away from this job without the money I’d planned to earn last night.

I waited for his answer while holding my breath and when none came I turned walking back to the living area. He was standing only a few inches away and my heart raced. Biting my lip hard I looked up into his fathomless eyes terrified and excited at the same time.

The smile that stretched over his beautiful face was almost that of a predator and my breath caught. “Tell me you don’t want to please me Miss Burns and I’ll call off the wager.”

Lie. That’s what my subconscious was screaming at me as my knees weakened and I felt sensations moving through my body that left no doubt in my mind that I did want something from him. I had no idea how to please a man like him and the safest thing I could do was bow out before he destroyed my heart.

“I think your eyes say it all Miss Burns. That and the flush on your cheeks and the way you’re clenching your thighs together. But I want to hear the words from that pretty little mouth. Do you want me?”

I couldn’t breathe. Forcing my eyes from his I lowered them and tried to find some semblance of reason. As much as I didn’t want to say the words, I wanted this man more than I wanted the air.

His large hand tangled in my hair and pulled my head back almost painfully. “Answer me! The softly spoken demand told me he wasn’t going to allow me to keep quiet and I whimpered softly, looking anywhere but at him. “Tell me.” His voice was whisper quiet and I broke.

Nodding I muttered the words that were guaranteed to haunt me long after his plans for me were finished. “I want you.” The words barely filtered through the air they were spoken so softly but there they were. Out there for his ears and damning my soul because I knew he wouldn’t let me take them back.





chapter Eight





Agreement


He released me so suddenly that I almost lost my balance. I don’t know what I expected after admitting my needs but him walking back to the couch and picking up his coffee cup definitely wasn’t anywhere on the list. “Join me.”

Wasn’t he supposed to jump me or drag me back to his bed after my affirmation? That’s how it always played out in the movies. Instead I found myself sitting down on the couch beside him trembling.

“There are things you should know about me before we take this any further.” He spoke like he was conducting a business interview and not some night of sexual pleasure that he expected me to fulfill his needs for.

“What things?” Why was I asking him that instead of packing my shit and running out the front door like any sane person might have done? The truth was I did want this man, even if it was only for one night. I had no idea how I’d work with him after or even if I could please him like our wager inferred. None of that mattered. Last night I’d been ready to run back home with my tail tucked between my legs and here I was now sitting on the couch waiting for him to explain his needs.

“What I’m about to explain to you never leaves this room. You are going to give me your verbal consent now.” The look he gave me was so fierce that I found myself nodding. “Use words. I want to know that we’re on the same page.”

“I promise not to share what you’re about to tell me with anyone.” I hoped like hell he wasn’t about to tell me he did something illegal because I wasn’t sure that was a promise I could keep. Tensing I stared at him wordlessly waiting for him to drop whatever secret he was about to reveal.

“You can relax Miss Burns. My secrets have harmed no one I’m just a very private person.” He chuckled softly as I exhaled deeply. “What I want may make you less relaxed.” His eyes probed mine and he seemed to be looking for something. I couldn’t hold his gaze and quickly lowered my eyes to my lap.

“I want to tie you up and do wicked things with your body.”

Holy shit maybe I should have taken my chances earlier and ran. “What kind of wicked things?” Why was I even asking him this question? Maybe because the thought of him doing them really left me aching in places I wasn’t even fully aware had needs before.

“Things that will make you come so hard you’ll wonder why you never thought about doing them before. I meant it when I said I wanted you to embrace your inner whore Miss Burns. I can teach you things that will make you long for what only I can give.”

I sat there with my mouth hanging open in stunned silence. In my mind I tried to imagine what things he could possibly do to me and came up completely blank. “How can you pleasing me actually please you? I thought you said you wanted pleasure?” I asked the only question that formed in my mind as I tried to understand what he wanted.

“Oh believe me Miss Burns I’ll get what I want. Using those sexy lips the way they were intended, making your body crave my touch, and demanding all your senses focus on nothing more than the ache between those sexy legs. You’ll surrender your entire body to my needs. That is something I’ll find more than pleasing.”

I was panting at the picture he painted in my mind and overwhelmed was putting it lightly. “You can make all that happen in one night?” I was riding the crazy train by even considering this scenario but the thought was definitely turning me on.

“I’ll take one night if that’s all you’ll give, but I hope to make your body ache for me so much you’ll agree for much longer.”

“I thought you didn’t do relationships?” What was I missing here because if he wanted this to last more than one night it obviously meant something else?

“It won’t be a relationship. You will surrender all control to me and I’ll use your body until I feel that you’ve given me all I need.”

What he was offering went against everything I believed in and more shockingly was the idea of how much I wanted to give in. He was right. If I agreed to his offer I would essentially become his whore and how dirty did that make me feel?

I stood up and paced across the living area knowing if I had any common sense I’d turn down this insane offer even if I risked being homeless to do it. That’s what my mind was telling me. My body was on a completely different page. The thought of letting him do wicked things to me left an odd thrum of pleasure and anticipation making my knees almost weak.

“How do you know I’ll like what you have in mind?” Whore. My subconscious screamed at me demanding I stop thinking between my legs. Curious. I shouted back mentally wondering why the whole world seemed to be so fascinated with sex and wanting to form my own opinion personally hand delivered by Taylor. Men in little white jackets, that’s what anyone would say who overheard my mental conversation at the moment.

“Because I know a woman’s body and yours is screaming to surrender your will to mine.”

Without even knowing I’d done it, my ankles had crossed and I was squeezing my thighs together to ease the ache that left me vulnerable. I immediately uncrossed and began pacing nervously, aware of how wet I was and flushing.

“I can ease that ache or maybe amplify it until I feel you deserve to be satisfied.” He sat back on the couch, his arm resting causally across the back telling me without words he knew he’d already won.

Deserve to be satisfied? What did that mean? The man wanted to tie me up and do things that I didn’t even fully understand. It finally dawned on me what he truly was. I’d read enough books and heard enough about the topic of BDSM from all the recent public fascination on the subject that I was surprised I didn’t catch it earlier. “You’re a sadist!”

Saying the words out loud I cringed. The idea of being hurt didn’t appeal to me in the least in fact keeping myself safe was my life goal. There was no one else in my life willing to look out for me, so I’d make it my priority. Wrapping my arms around myself I glared at him demanding he admit what a real pervert he was.

“I don’t find pleasure in inflicting pain on women, Miss Ross. Quite the opposite I assure you.” He seemed amused which left me staring at him in confusion. “Granted I enjoy light bondage, but only because I feel it helps allow my partner to release the preconceived notions of what is expected in society. What I want from you doesn’t require humiliation or punishments.”

“But if I’m tied up how do I know you’ll stop if something isn’t, um pleasurable.” My face burned at the question and I rested my eyes on the floor again.

“Well Miss Burns I think you’ve proven on numerous occasions that you have no problem speaking. You open your mouth and tell me.” The soft chuckle that filled the room had my eyes flying back to his entirely too handsome face and he grew serious. “It doesn’t mean I will though. What you think your body craves doesn’t always correlate with what the mind considers acceptable.”

How could I agree to this? If I allowed him to tie me up he’d made it known that even if I told him to stop it was his decision whether or not to release me. What if he did things that hurt me without him thinking it would? I was still a virgin, not that I had any intention of discussing that with him at the moment. There was no way I could allow this to go any further.

“You’re overthinking this Laura. I give you my word that all I want is to give pleasure.” He stood up and walked over behind me, his hands resting on my shoulders. They were so tense I wasn’t sure I’d ever relax again.

He’d used my name again. I wasn’t sure why that affected me so deeply but between that and the massage he was now giving I was tempted to just say yes. His hands felt so oddly comforting even as my mind was reeling from what he wanted from me. “No insertion.” The words just fell from my lips as if I were trying to find a way to allow him his will without giving him the opportunity to cause me pain.

He lowered his mouth to my ear and I almost melted into him. “Of any kind?” God he was trying to tempt me and I knew a part of me wanted him to win and it terrified me.

I shook my head almost moaning when his hands stopped the gentle caress. Was he changing his mind? I didn’t want him to. I didn’t want to part with my secret though so I couldn’t give in. Tensing, I felt like my entire life hung on the balance of what he decided.

“I won’t fuck you until you beg.” He conceded and began squeezing my shoulders again. “But what about my tongue?” To emphasize his words his tongue flicked over my earlobe before sucking gently.

Inhaling deeply I fought for control and found none. “I guess that would be fine.” The thought of where he was planning on using that unfair weapon of his made my heart race wildly.

“And your mouth? I want to fuck those beautiful lips and for that to happen I’ll have to break your rule.” His hand moved around my front to cup my breast through the bathrobe and my nipples tightened instantly. The sensation was almost painful I was so aroused.

I strained against that large hand and nodded, knowing that at the moment I’d break all my rules if he just continued what he was doing. Instead of granting my wish, his hands dropped without warning untying the sash of my robe.

I gasped as it fell upon and covered my breasts with my hands. I felt more exposed than I had ever felt before and wanted to close it until his hand grazed lightly over my stomach and continued until he was cupping my sex. Only the thin panties I wore separated his hand from my flesh.

“Fingers?” He rubbed his thumb over the slit of my sex lightly and I cried out softly at the waves of pleasure his touch gave.

“Oh please.” He increased the pressure with one hand grasping my hip with the other keeping our bodies pressed together.

“I intend to please you. So yes to fingers?”

He wasn’t fighting fair and my head rested back on his shoulder as those well practiced digits continued to stroke in just the right way. “Yes.” The word escaped on a rush of air as his thumb pressed hard against my clit and without warning I came undone instantly.

The man had barely touched me and I was already unravelling. He turned me in his arms and pulled my hands from my breasts. Shivering I watched his eyes take in the sight and the look in his eyes made me ache again. “So fucking beautiful.” His words were spoken almost in reverence and I knew I was lost.

“We’ve established that I won’t fuck you until you beg and I can use my fingers and tongue however I choose. Now I have a few of my own terms.” His familiar smirk was back and I shivered at the coolness of being so exposed.

I reached for the lapels on my robe and he shook his head. “Don’t cover your body from me. I enjoy the view and would prefer to see even more of it. For now this will do.” He reached for the robe, sliding it from my shoulders to pool on the floor.

Motioning toward the couch he sat and it took everything I had in me not to grab it back up and instead force my legs to walk in just my panties to sit down with him again. My fingers bit into the leather to keep from crossing over my chest as his gaze moved over me.

The thrill of seeing the pleasure looking at me gave him almost made up for the embarrassment I felt. It’s just fatty flesh, I told myself over and over again trying desperately to not feel so exposed.

“My terms are simple Miss Burns. When we are alone I expect you to be undressed and be willing to let me do whatever I choose to bring you pleasure at any given time. If I ask you to pleasure my body the same rules apply. No questions asked. On that note I will never ask you to do anything in public unless I know that our privacy is assured.”

Holy shit. He was planning on doing things to me in public tonight? I wasn’t sure I could really go along with that. Obviously he didn’t want to be on the front page of the tabloids because of his business reputation, but in public? Think Laura, think. What could he really do in a public place that people wouldn’t notice? That reassurance made me nod.

“I need you to speak your words. Consider it another term I’m setting forth.” His tone had moved from sensual, mocking, and now stern. Even his eyes were cold as he waited on me to comply with his wishes.

“I agree.” I managed a whisper but if he wanted more I didn’t think I could give it. My mind was still reeling at sitting here partially nude as we had a conversation that overwhelmed me in ways I couldn’t explain.

Instantly his expression softened and he stood to his imposing height. “Good. Then I think my first order of business is getting you ready. Let’s move to the bathroom.” He walked away and I assumed he expected me to follow. I managed to find my feet but as I followed him my mind was in a daze.





chapter Nine





Clean Slate


He adjusted the water for the shower and I stood there on the cool tile longing to cover myself again. To stop myself from doing that I rocked from one foot to the other and clenched my hands by my sides. Without pretense he demanded softly that I lose the panties.

Did he wink at me? I was floored at the simple gesture but it was so quick and he was rambling through drawers pulling out things while I had a nervous breakdown. I wasn’t sure I could just bare my ass to him. The light in the bathroom certainly didn’t offer any compassion. I knew every flaw I had would be visible.

His arms were full of items when he turned back to me. Shaking his head he placed them on the side of the tub then glanced down at the underwear I was still wearing. “Either take them off or tell me you’ve changed your mind.”

I bit my lip hard and somehow managed to slide the small scrap of silk down my legs then stepped out of them. I was shaking so badly that I wrapped my arms around my waist to calm myself.

His arms folded me into his embrace and held me tightly. The small sign of compassion made me feel less lost than I had giving in to his demand. “You’re a beautiful woman Miss Burns and it pleases me greatly to look at the view.”

Releasing me, he reached down and grabbed a plastic hairclip. With startling efficiency he pulled my long curly locks into a simple flip making me feel even more exposed to his eyes than I already was. “Step in.”

The steamy water streamed over my sensitized flesh and for a brief moment I felt some since of normalcy. That lasted long enough to notice he was stripping off his own clothes and my eyes were able to concede that he didn’t stuff his pants.

I wasn’t sure why but my eyes had immediately been drawn to his huge shaft and I was mentally thanking myself for demanding him not to have sex with me. The rest of his body was almost painfully beautiful and it made me feel self-conscious once again about my own.

Was it even fair that the man was like perusing a living walk of art? Broad shoulders gave way to powerful biceps that made my fingers long to trace them or be wrapped in an embrace. His smooth chest and artfully sculpted abs enhanced the strength of his persona and were almost breathtaking Long legs forced my gaze down to his feet and proved you could judge a man by his shoe size.

I felt consumed by the masculinity of him, my head swimming in the knowledge that somehow this god of male virility wanted me. Finally my eyes found his beautiful face and the look of desire in those eyes along with the supreme confidence written upon it was a heady drug in itself.

“Hands on your head Miss Burns.” His full lips lifted in a slight smile as he spoke and without thought I immediately complied.

“Such a good girl.”

I felt overwhelmed by him. My breath caught and held as his hands whispered over my collarbone, traced over my breasts and spanned my quivering abdomen. The water splaying over me along with his touch was almost too much. Ignoring that part of me that was aching to be touched, he continued downward. His hands gained knowledge of my thighs with a touch that was so slight had I not been so attuned to him I might have not felt at all.

My head swam, forcing me to inhale only to exhale harshly as he knelt before me. His face was so close to my sex that I felt the heat of his breath against the soft curls. When his fingers tugged lightly I cried out softly.

“I will remove these and if you’re very still I’ll pleasure your pussy as a reward.”

The dirty words and the slight pull he gave were nearly my undoing and my core flooded with passion. He was going to shave me. There! Outside of shaving my bikini line I’d never really groomed myself in that area and I was speechless. I was so nervous that when his finger slid through that downy hair, I jumped, startled.

He chuckled softly and lifted his hand. “That will never do Miss Burns. Imagine if I had a razor against that tender flesh and you had made such a move.”

“I’m sorry.” Mumbling softly as my face heated, I wanted to hide at his reprimand. He stood and pulled me from underneath the water. I lowered my hands to cover my chest. Feeling insecure I refused to look at him.

God I couldn’t breathe. Standing naked with him in the shower was already pushing myself past any experience I had. It was stupid to think I could go through with this. He was a man of obvious experience and I was this girl in a woman’s body who had no idea how to respond.

Turning my back on him, my shoulders drooped and I wanted to sink into the sudden self-pity that told me I wasn’t worthy enough to be touched by him. I felt his arms surround my waist, pulling me against the hardness of his chest and it was too much. I wanted him and knowing that he was disappointed forced tears into my eyes. I wasn’t going to let him see me cry. Struggling in his grip I knew this was a huge mistake.

“Laura stop!” His soft demand and the way he held me tightly against him didn’t allow me the space I needed to escape. The tears slid down my cheeks and I trembled hating the weakness inside that I’d fought all my life to overcome.

He turned me in his arms and I felt him tense. Strong fingers lifted my chin and knowing he was witnessing my mental anguish made the humiliation even greater. “Talk to me.” His words echoed confusion and I couldn’t look into his eyes, instead I struggled against his hold on my chin wanting to sneak away and lick my wounds in private.

“Baby you’re scaring the fuck out me right now. Talk to me.” He was scared? The thought of this strong, confident man being afraid because of me was shocking. I stopped fighting him and gazed into his eyes. There was no doubt confusion in those depths but the concern laced with it made me gasp.

As much of an asshole as I’d seen him be I didn’t understand why he would care that I was upset. I wanted to give him an explanation if for no other reason because he seemed concerned. “No one’s ever seen me like this before.”

He seemed more confused by my words and seeing Taylor Ross with an expression other than supreme confidence was almost comical. The waterworks stopped and I shook my head. “I’ve never shown my body to a man.”

Recognition filled his face and he relaxed. “Your lovers have been idiots then.” That familiar smirk was back and he pulled me against him tightly, wrapping his arms around my waist. “I forget how young you are.” He whispered the words into my ear and drew us both under the water again.

Just that quick the fear of being not good enough melted away and I returned his embrace. He breathed a sigh of relief and I was confounded again. The emotions with him were insane. Crying one moment and aching with desire the next. “If you want to forget this I’ll understand.” I knew a man like him was used to women with much more experience and doubted he wanted to waste time with someone like me.

He pulled back and his expression was incredulous. “Because you’re shy? Fuck baby that actually turns me on.” Smiling down at me he winked and I felt myself relax. “I look forward to making you burn so bad your nudity won’t matter.”

His hard length against my belly told me more than words could about how honest he was being. He still wanted me? I definitely wasn’t going to argue, especially when he pulled back and grabbed a bottle of liquid soap and began washing me with such tenderness that my heart raced again.

Taylor was such a contradiction. I might have thought more about that except the way his talented hands were bringing my body to life left me little time to think about anything outside of pleasure.

“I’m still taking these curls Miss Burns.” His fingers massaged the cool suds into that part of me that was aching deliciously and I didn’t care what he took as long as he didn’t stop. “I love how wet you are for me.”

He quickly turned me around, removing the pleasure those fingers were giving and I wanted to scream in protest. My back was treated to the same thorough cleansing and even though it felt incredible I wanted his fingers back where I longed for them the most. I stiffened as they trailed through the creases of my twin moons and he washed me meticulously there.

When he asked that I lift my foot and I complied, I quickly forgot how strange it felt to have his fingers tracing my other entrance. The tickling sensation of his fingers moving between my toes overrode everything. I almost lost my balance as he continued, laughing at the sweet torture of having hands on my feet.

“You should have hidden the fact that you’re ticklish Miss Burns.” He was merciless as he lifted my other foot making me squirm with his teasing digits.

“No more, please.” I was laughing so hard that my sides hurt and he finally took mercy on me.

“Rinse off that delectable body and do it quickly then.” His mocking sternness had me giggling again until he raised his hand doing a tickling motion and I quickly moved back under the water.

With all the suds removed he quickly washed his own body and rinsed off, and I tried not to pout at not being able to learn his body. “There will be no pouting Miss Burns. I have a mission to accomplish.”

I had no idea what he was talking about and raised an eyebrow in confusion.

“I do believe we have some grooming to do.” The strength in his voice was offset with the humor in his eyes and it helped me not feel as nervous about what he wanted to do. He tapped a long finger on his full lips as if contemplating. Turning back to the tap, he turned off the water and stepped out of the shower.

He grabbed a towel from the rack and briskly dried off, then wrapped it around his waist securely before pulling down another. “Step out, Miss Burns.” There was a glint in his eyes that made me nervous and excited at the same time and I didn’t hesitate to do as he asked.

With slow unhurried movements he dried each inch of my flesh until I was once again a trembling mass of need. Laying the towel out on the floor he patted it and I looked at him confused.

“I want you to lay down on it, Miss Burns.” The sensual smirk almost seemed to be daring me to do what he asked and I bit my lip before moving to do his bidding. “Rest your arms under your head for cushion.”

I trembled at the coolness of the air on my skin and he shook his head before walking over to pull down yet another towel. With patience he draped the soft fluffiness over my neck, shoulders and stomach, leaving my lower half exposed.

“I need you to trust me. Can you do that?” He was towering above my prone body and I bit my lip but nodded. I wanted to trust him but from this angle he was almost larger than life and I was admittedly nervous.

“I’ll have you speaking words before I’m done Miss Burns.” Again he winked and it made me feel he wasn’t truly angry about it. He gathered a can of shaving cream and the razor from the side of the bath, then walked over to the sink to fill a glass with water placing them all beside me. Lowering before me, his hands grasped my ankles and spread my legs wide before sitting between them.

Without any conscious thought I whimpered feeling more exposed than ever before. I was resting my head on my arms and our gazes met. He smiled reassuringly and I attempted to remain still. That act in itself took more courage than I thought I possessed. He could see every flaw from this position and I closed my eyes tightly afraid he wouldn’t like the view.

“Laura, look at me.” His softly uttered demand forced my eyes up, only he wasn’t looking at my face. Instead his gaze rested between my thighs on the flesh that ached to feel his touch again. “”You’re beautiful here. All that soft pink flesh makes me want to taste and suck until you forget everything but how good I can make you feel.”

I flushed and he smiled and even though the nervousness didn’t dissipate, I was no longer worried about how he saw me but instead I longed for his touch again. With skillful precision he shaved the most intimate parts and I fought to keep still. Embarrassment didn’t even enter into the equation, my body was quivering in need from the impersonal feel of his fingers as he groomed me.

My eyes had closed needing to find some control as he completed the intimate act and I wasn’t prepared for the feel of his palm soothing over the now bare mound of my sex. For the first time since he started I jumped, thankfully he wasn’t shaving any longer.

“Rinse off Miss Burns, then let me reward you for being such a good girl.” He waited until I stood and as I stepped back in the shower he cleaned up the aftermath. A towel was waiting for me again when I finished and I stepped into it with anticipation.

It felt so strange to have the curls removed but I was also more sensitive to each touch of my body there. When he pressed the towel over that spot I moaned softly, then flushed as I realized what I had done.

“Now you are ready for me.” He dropped the towel carelessly on the floor and took my hand in his. Leading me out into his bedroom I was nothing but a bundle of nerves when we stopped at his bed.

He lifted me by my waist and sat me down on the edge. I was somewhat surprised when he sat down with me and continued to hold my hand. “Do you remember what I told you I wanted to do Miss Burns?”

It was hard to remember anything with his thumb running lightly over my hand and the intensity in his expressive blue eyes. I couldn’t think and I shook my head no softly.

He grinned with such a look of delight on his face that my breath caught. “I told you I wanted to tie you up and do wicked things to you.” At my gasp his grin widened. “Since we decided that I wouldn’t fuck you, at least with my cock, I want to fuck that pretty little pussy with my tongue. And I still want to tie you up.”

His words shocked me but not as much as the clenching of my inner folds did because of them. My breath rushed from my lips and I nodded before I could stop myself.

“Words Miss Ross. Do I have permission to tie you up and fuck that delicious little cunt with my tongue?”

His dirty talk had a straight line to my core and I was so shocked by his now demanding persona that it took me a moment to find my voice. “Y-yes.” I was once again overwhelmed and trembling.

“Then don’t move.” He stood and walked over to his bedroom closet and pulled out a huge, black leather, overnight bag. I heard him moving things around and I was curious about what things were inside. Maybe it was better I didn’t know, I thought to myself, because I’d just agreed to let him be the first man to give me oral. What if I tasted funny and he hated it? I’d just showered but I bled down there once a month. How could a man enjoy doing something like that? Lost in my own fears I jumped when he joined me on the bed again.

“What’s wrong Laura?” Somewhere in my overworking mind I realized he only called me Laura when he sensed I was nervous or afraid.

“I’ve never done this before.” Did he think I was some stupid girl now that I admitted that to him? I hoped he wasn’t changing his mind, or maybe it would be better if I did. My nerves were getting the best of me again.

“Which part, the bondage or letting a man eat your pussy?’ He spoke the words so rationally and I couldn’t even say the C word without flinching.

“Either.” Or was it neither? I was working myself into another panic and twisted my hands nervously in my lap together.

“Once again your lovers have been fucking idiots. You’ll enjoy this and I want to please you this way. All you have to do is trust me Laura.” His warm, almost hypnotizing voice, soothed me. “Can you trust me?”

I nodded then remembered he liked when I spoke. “If it pleases you I can.” I didn’t know how to explain that I was more worried that he wouldn’t like how I tasted then the fear of the act itself.”

“Oh baby that makes me really happy.” He gave me a smile so sexy that my insides quivered. How could I not return it? “Scoot up to the top of the bed then Miss Burns.”

Again with the wink. It did something I can’t explain seeing him give such simple approval. I quickly moved to the top of the bed and waited for him to explain what he wanted next.

He held up some strange leather cuffs lined with fur and attached to them were two dangling chains. “These attach to a bed. The bed at my house already has chains attached to it but when I travel I have make allowances.”

He had chains on his bed at home? Obviously he was really into the whole bondage thing. I tried not to wonder how many woman he’d done this with before because for reasons I didn’t want to contemplate the thought of him with someone else made me envious.

“Just lie down on the pillow, and I’ll do the rest Miss Burns.” I did as he asked hoping that my heart didn’t pound out of my chest. With obvious skill he wrapped the cuff around one of my wrists then secured the chain to the bedpost. It felt strange having my arm over my head and I tugged lightly to see if it gave way. It didn’t budge and when he finished my other wrist I pulled again.

There was a brief moment of panic when I realized I couldn’t release myself. My eyes flew to his and he smiled as if he somehow understood what I was feeling.

“Trust. I won’t let anything happen to you Laura.” Again with my first name. Just hearing him say it helped me find the confidence I needed in my safety.

His hand trailed over my thigh in a soft caress until he reached my ankle. With resolve he encased it in a larger fur-lined cuff and the longer chain I heard jangling as he secured it to footboard. I bit my lip hard feeling more nervous about what he was doing until he lightly tickled my foot again, making me forget everything.

“I told you that you shouldn’t give away your weaknesses.” Mercifully he stopped the torture and lifted my other ankle. “I’m going to spread you wide Miss Burns so I can have my wicked way with you.”

He proceeded to do just that and I was now more exposed than I felt I had been in the floor of his bathroom earlier. My wrists and ankles were held fast with his skill and I tugged on the bonds not sure how I felt about being at his mercy this way.

He stood up and my eyes followed him until he whipped the towel off his waist. One look at his hard shaft raising up toward his six-pack abs looking so imposing with its long, thick width had me closing my eyes.

“Look at me Laura.” I forced my eyes open and his smile was awe inspiring. “I don’t want you to feel intimidated by me. His hand grasped his cock, oh god I just thought C word, stroking it smoothly. “I especially don’t want you to think I’d hurt you with this. In fact I want you to get very comfortable with it because he longs to fill your mouth.”

He talked about his cock like it was a second person and I couldn’t stop the laugh that escaped. “You call your, um thing, a he?” I bit my lip knowing I probably shouldn’t be laughing especially since I was basically tied up and helpless at the moment, but I couldn’t help it.

He tried to look affronted at my humor but failed and smiled broadly. “It’s not a thing, it’s a cock. You’re a grown woman and I know you can say it. Let me hear it Miss Burns.” He was daring me with his expression and I flushed shaking my head no. “Afraid of the word cock. We definitely can’t have that. Say it for me Laura.” He was begging now? How could I resist that?

“Fine. Cock.” I muttered under my breath feeling my cheeks flush.

“Good girl. And yes, I call my cock a he. Sometimes he has a mind of his own and I’ve had to train him to behave.” Were we really here having a conversation about his cock. Please kill me now. It was so funny that I forgot to be nervous at all. I giggled.

“That’s what I like to hear Miss Burns.” He released himself and came between my legs and my laugher stopped. “Taking away that beautiful sound? I guess I’ll have to find another one worthy of its replacement.” Without warning his head lowered and his tongue delved into my silken folds forcing a soft moan from my lips.

He lifted his head and smirked. “Now that sound pleases me even more, Miss Burns.” He lowered his head once more and I was lost to sensation.

There was no gentleness in his actions as he devoured my core with passionate strokes of his tongue down each side of my seam until I was writhing in ecstasy. He suckled my clit almost roughly and I screamed out my pleasure not prepared for how wonderful it felt to be worshipped this way.

Relentless in his pursuit his fingers spread me even further apart and he continued to indulge in the juices my body was flooding over until I was thrashing my head from side to side in undisguised need. I didn’t care what I tasted like only that he continue pleasing my body with the skill that somehow I knew he was a master of.

Just when I thought the pleasure couldn’t be any greater he darted his tongue deep inside my chamber and I bucked my hips off the bed. “Oh god!” My core tensed and it was almost painful as he speared me again and again. The floodgates released and I shattered into a world of bliss. He continued his assault until I rode out every wave of pleasure and was trembling with fulfillment like I’d never known before.

He suckled my clit and the sensation bordered on painful my sex was so sensitive now. I whimpered, tensing and attempting to move away.

He released my flesh and lifted up my body resting on his outstretched arms above me. Lowering his lips to mine, he kissed me and the taste of my own flavor on him was strange but heady. Lifting his lips, he smiled down on me. “Your pussy was incredible Miss Burns. I will have to feast there more often.”

The man had no mouth filter, I thought and giggled in embarrassment. I had just had the most mind blowing orgasm of my life and was laughing. Were those two things allowed to happen simultaneously? I had no idea but it felt incredible and I honestly didn’t care if it was normal or not.

“What about you?” I felt his hardness against my belly and wondered if it was painful. “Doesn’t it hurt you to not, um well you know, get off?” I whispered the words feeling naughty for speaking those words out loud.

He chuckled softly and shook his head. “So sweet.” He kissed me again. “We’ll work on that, but to answer your question, it doesn’t feel great not to come. Do you want to taste me?”

Did I? I didn’t have a clue how to give a blow job but the thought of him hurting didn’t make me feel good after the pleasure he’d given me. “I’d like to but you’ll have to teach me.” I was embarrassed again. I wished I had more experience and could offer him what he wanted.

“Miss Burns what am I going to do with you.” He winked to show me he wasn’t upset and I was surprised. My mother’s lovers and husbands had seemed almost brutal when she didn’t give them what they demanded. Granted I didn’t know what happened in their bedroom but in everyday life they seemed to demand their needs. Taylor was so different that it was confusing.

I was lost in my own world again and didn’t notice he was releasing me from the cuffs until my hand fell free. He gently massaged my wrist before removing the other and followed the same action. The man before me was an enigma and I found myself wanting to understand him.

When I was completely free he pulled me up into a sitting position and I was almost shocked when he took my hand and placed it on his cock. Thinking that word was getting easier, I decided. “I think we’ll start by letting you please me this way. I don’t want that pretty little mouth working too hard today.”

The feel of him was unexpected. He looked so hard but the skin covering him was almost soft. It was a contradiction almost like the man himself. I wrapped my fingers carefully around the base, shocked that he was so large I couldn’t make them touch. Definitely a good thing he’d promised not to fill me up, I was sure it wouldn’t fit.

He covered my hand with his own and tutored me in stroking him. I was astounded when a tiny drop of liquid emerged from the mushroom shaped head and found myself curious. Lowering my head quickly I swiped my tongue over the droplet and discovered I liked the taste.

Without thought I squeezed tightly and opened my mouth wide to suckle his enlarged head. It stretched my lips and I could barely take him in but I was determined to try. He’d pleased me so much with his mouth and I wanted to return the favor. Not to mention that this was something I’d never done and I wanted the experience.

“Laura.” My name slid from his lips in a deep groan and I somehow knew that this was pleasing him. I relaxed and allowed his huge girth to slide in deeper. I wasn’t sure why this turned me on but I knew I had to have more of him.

Allowing my tongue to swirl around I took him even deeper then slid free so I could breathe. I wanted to devour him as he had me and with no skill but lots of determination, I slowly rode him with my mouth. He tasted salty and all man and the combination was suddenly something I craved.

Moaning I continued suckling him, moving my hand up and down his width with a rhythm all my own. His hand that had been guiding me moved to the back of my neck caressing and I was on my own. My head bobbed up and down as I tried to take him even deeper each time.

“Baby I’m going to come in your mouth if you don’t stop.” His hips were raising up to meet my mouth as it lowered and that forced him even deeper. I wasn’t listening to his words. I wanted to make him fall apart and it was a huge sense of power to know I had the ability to make it happen.

I was only taking half of him and I wanted even more. Releasing my hold I pushed down until I almost gagged, then relaxed my throat. I had no clue what I was doing but I enjoyed the taste and feel of him this way and refused to give up the new skill I’d learned.

His hand gripped the back of my neck tightly as I suckled him in deeper and then I felt his release sliding down my throat and swallowed in awe. I wasn’t sure how to feel about the taste of him for a moment and then I glanced upward. The sight of him unraveled was enough to make me forget everything, it was a beauty to behold.

I drank every drop until he pulled me away, dragging me into his arms. He wiped away the excess with his thumb and smiled down on me with such adoration that I wanted to try that again. “Sweet, dirty girl. You amaze me.”

He lowered his lips and kissed me with a passion that left me breathless. We rested back on the pillows spent and I allowed my mind to take in the passion he’d opened my eyes to. I never knew it could be like this and all we’d done was oral. I wondered what other pleasures he could teach me and I knew that one day was never going to be enough.

My head rested against his chest now and he stroked my hair. “What’s going on in that beautiful mind of yours Miss Burns?”

I allowed my hands to trace over his chest, and then around the small nub of his breast wondering how to ask him. “I was just wondering if you wanted to keep doing this?” I decided asking was the only way to find out.

“Do I want to keep allowing that sexy little mouth to please me?” He chuckled and pulled me on top of his body. “Look at me Miss Burns.” It felt so strange to be resting on him this way but I knew he was capable of holding my slight weight. I lifted my eyes self-consciously meeting his and waited.

“What is it you want to really know?” I wanted to pull my gaze away in case he wasn’t on board but I forced myself to not drop my eyes.

“More than one night?” I couldn’t hold his gaze any longer because if he said no I wasn’t sure I could deal with the humiliation.

“Why do you want more?” He obviously didn’t want it and I needed to stop now. Rolling off him, I tried to contain my disappointment. I was going to climb out of the bed but he pulled me back and wrapped me in his arms tightly. “I asked you a question Miss Burns.”

I struggled in his hold feeling embarrassed for asking and shook my head. “It doesn’t matter. I, well, um thanks for today.” Could I feel like more of a fool? I wanted to go back to my room and hide my head under the covers.

“Silly little girl,” he chuckled again and turned me over to lay underneath him. “I enjoyed pleasing you and that little mouth of yours made me come faster than I ever have before. So I’m asking you what you want here Laura, because if it were up to me I’d claim you until you had no say so in the matter. Do you understand me?”

Claim me? What did that mean? I wasn’t sure I even cared as long as it meant he didn’t want to stop doing what we’d done today. “You still want me?”

He rubbed his cock against my stomach and I trembled realizing he was hard again. “I think the answer to that is pretty obvious Miss Burns. But are you willing to be mine?”

“I don’t understand what you’re asking.” Again I really didn’t care because I wanted to take him into my mouth again and please him like I had earlier before all this self-doubt overwhelmed me again. At least when I was pleasing him I knew he wanted the same thing.

“Agree to be mine. Let me fuck you with my mouth, my tongue, and even my cock. Tell me that you’ll let me do whatever I want to your body and not refuse me anything. That’s what I want Miss Burns and if you don’t want the same thing then now would be the time to say it.”

He wanted me. Okay well my body at least. Holy shit could I agree to that. Not without explaining a few things first I couldn’t. The thought of making love to him terrified me. Not making love, fucking. He’d made it pretty clear he didn’t do the sweet stuff. Was I ready for that?

“I’ve never had sex before.” I mumbled the words more to myself than him and again questioned if I was able to offer my body to him completely.

“What did you say?” The look he gave me was incredulous and almost accusing. The temperature in the room seemed to drop ten degrees and I don’t know why but I was suddenly afraid. I bit my lip and shivered not sure why he looked like he wanted to hit something.

I’d seen that look with my mom’s third husband and since he randomly smacked her around before she decided to bail I knew I didn’t want it directed at me. “I’m sorry.” Deflect. That’s the lesson I learned growing up. If you apologized things didn’t seem to go as bad.

Taylor slid off me and sat on the edge of the bed, his hand moving through his dark locks. “Fuck Laura don’t look at me like you think I’d hurt you.” He stood and paced the room and I sat up drawing my knees to my chest. “How are you a virgin?”

He wasn’t looking at me and the question was spoken into the air. My smart ass self-defense mode wanted to kick in and tell him the obvious answer but I was still worried about his anger. Instead I just kept my mouth shut and watched him pace.

For several minutes he didn’t speak at all, instead he wore a path in the carpet. “Can I get dressed?” I felt asking him instead of just doing what I wanted was the smartest idea. He still seemed like he wanted to hit something and I wasn’t offering him a willing target.

He turned back to me as if he suddenly remembered I was there. “Grab a shower and get dressed, I’ll take us out to eat.” Rubbing his jaw I could see that he was still lost in thought. I had no idea why he was so pissed off but I wasn’t asking him anything until he calmed down.





chapter Ten





Confusion


I walked back to my bathroom and quickly washed off. It still felt strange to be shaved so intimately and I hurried to erase the evidence of our earlier passion. I couldn’t touch myself there without thinking of how wonderful it felt to have his mouth on me.

It took forever to dry my hair and then I stood staring into my closet in my panties and bra trying to decide what to wear. I opted for a pair of navy dress pants and a white butterfly collared shirt. It wasn’t overly dressy and I figured if we ended up someplace casual it would work there too. I slid on a pair of heels and walked out to the main living area.

Taylor was dressed in a pair of khakis with a cream colored cable-knit sweater and my mouth watered at the sight of him. I was in heat, I scolded myself remembering how those fingers and mouth had made me feel. He gave me a half smile which made me worry that he wasn’t as pleased as I was about what we shared.

“The hotel has a great dining room, I thought we’d just stay here then talk after?” This was not the same confident man that convinced me to seduce a client, or even the one who’d shown me such pleasure in the bedroom. I was confused. I nodded and he didn’t seem to mind that I didn’t give him the words.

The food was delicious but the atmosphere hanging between me and Taylor was anything but calming. He seemed distant and I wondered if this was how it would be when we went back to work Monday. Maybe he only showed his emotions in private. I was hoping that was the case. The alternative was he regretted what we’d done.

I refused desert and we walked back to the penthouse elevator without saying a word. I hated the silence and was willing to do just about anything for him to tell me why he was acting this way. “Have I done something wrong?” Those words sounded as weak as they made me feel and I waited nervously for him to answer.

He shook his head no and continued the silent treatment until we walked through the door to the suite. “Would you like something to drink?” The words were calm and cool and I wanted to scream.

“No. What I want is for you to tell me why you’re being so quiet!” I shouldn’t have screamed at him but I didn’t like this not knowing and it ticked me off.

“I’m angry because I took advantage of you and thought you were something that you obviously aren’t.”

What the hell was he talking about? “I enjoyed the things we did and I didn’t tell you I was a virgin because I was afraid you’d think I wasn’t enough.” If anything I’d mislead him because I didn’t want my lack of experience to make him not want me.

“I enjoyed pleasing you and you gave me great pleasure but I thought you were experienced. Hell Laura I tied you up and shaved your pussy, that’s not what your first experience should be like.”

“Why not? It was something I’ll never forget.” This self-loathing I heard in his tone was ridiculous. “I’d let you do it again if you’d stop second guessing yourself.”

He turned to me with a stunned expression. “Baby you don’t need that kind of kink until you’ve experienced some of the normal things.”

“What you mean is you don’t want some inexperienced woman when some whore could please you more than I could.” I turned my back on him and stomped off to my room. He couldn’t even tell me that I wasn’t enough for him. Instead he tried to ease my feelings. I was so mad I wanted to hit something.

I stood staring through the glass wall at the busy city street below and wished I’d never confessed my lack of experience to him. It had never bothered me before but now that I knew what Taylor could offer I hated that I’d consciously chosen not to date. I’d watched my mother with her parade of men and it disgusted me. I’m sure a shrink would say I’d been emotionally scarred from the way I was raised.

Ironically I thought that Taylor would have enjoyed being with a woman like her. I felt his hands on my shoulders and tensed. Did a woman have to be experienced to be a whore? “I could’ve learned to give you the things you wanted.” I felt defeated and really didn’t want to fight with him again.

“You deserve someone who can give you the fairytale Laura.” He moved his hands from my shoulders to wrap around my waist and I rested my head back on his chest.

“I don’t want it. I want you.” I shouldn’t be telling him this. He obviously needed something I couldn’t give.

“Baby I would fuck you up walking you through my world, but I’m so damn tempted.”

He was tempted? Then I was going to give him more incentive. Maybe he did still want me. I reached behind me and stroked him through his pants. I might not know many things about pleasing a man but the way he hardened against me instantly proved that I could at least make him want me.

He released me and took a step back. “I can’t be what you need Laura. All I can offer you is pleasure. You should find some nice guy, fall in love, have a few kids, and be taken care of.”

Rolling my eyes I walked toward him as he backed away. Did he know me at all? “I don’t want those things. I want to go to college and become self-sufficient. But I also want you. And I don’t care if you can’t love me, what I need now is pleasure. I know you can give me that and it doesn’t involve a commitment that would ruin my plans for the future.”

He looked at me stunned and I finally stopped when our bodies were scant inches apart. “You told me to embrace my inner whore, Taylor. Well I’m offering myself to you without any holds barred. So I guess the real question is are you willing to give me what I need?”

All I can say is the devil made me do it because I reached out and grabbed him in my hand giving a little squeeze. “Can you be the man that makes me the whore he craves?”

“Fuck Laura.” He wrapped his hand in my hair and pulled back but I refused to let go of his cock. “If I hurt you I’ll never forgive myself.” Lowering his lips he kissed me savagely and I knew for the moment I’d won. Could a virgin be a whore? I guess I was about to find out.

I was terrified he’d change his mind so I continued stroking him as our tongues danced. The thought of him turning me away again made my heart ache and I knew I’d do whatever it took to be the woman he needed. Pulling my lips away I kept my hand in place. “Touch me Taylor.”

“There’s a special place in hell for me for what I’m going to do to you baby.” He grabbed me by the ass, lifted and my legs wrapped around his waist and I had no choice but to let go of his cock and hold on as he stalked back to his bedroom.

“Get out of those clothes.” He dropped me on the bed and I didn’t have time to be stunned. This is what I wanted. Taylor unleashed, so full of desire that he stopped thinking and gave me what I craved.

I stripped with fumbling fingers not giving a damn that I was baring my body for him. There was no sanity, no time to think, only make the most of the moment before he grew a conscious again and turned me away. Completely nude I rested back on the bed, lifting my arms over my head, clasping my hands together.

He ripped off his clothes as if he had no patience for them and joined me on the bed. “Keep those hands there baby. If you touch me right now I’ll lose all control.” His head lowered and his mouth nuzzled my neck.

The feel of his hot flesh pressed against mine made me whimper and I opened my legs. His strong chest rubbed against my breasts making my nipples pebble and ache. My feet wrapped around his well-rounded ass and I felt his cock against my stomach, throbbing and growing harder with each passing second.

He pulled away from me and I cried out in denial. “Keep those gorgeous legs parted baby, and don’t move them again. I don’t want to tie you down.”

I remembered how he had spread me open with the ankle cuffs earlier and tried to mimic the position. It left me so openly exposed that I wanted to shut them. “Tie me down.” It was so much easier when I didn’t have the choice and I needed to be what he wanted.

He slid off the bed and ran a hand through his hair as he stared down at me. “You’re killing me here baby. I’m trying to do right by you.”

“Please Taylor.” I needed the freedom of being bound even though I couldn’t understand just why it made things easier.

“Fuck!” The cuffs were still attached to the bed. He lifted one ankle cuff and brought it toward my foot. “If you want out of this you better damn well tell me.” He waited for my nod and then quickly secured one ankle, then the next. “I want it all, Laura.” He moved to the top of the bed and lifted the wrist restraint. He waited until I offered my hand then quickly encased it. I offered the other wrist without him asking.

I was panting as he glanced down at me, aching with a desire that overwhelmed me to the point that thinking was no longer possible. When he joined me again in bed, his hands were everywhere. Cupping the weight of my breasts, splaying over my quivering abdomen, and tracing down my legs and back up again. Lifting my ass and squeezing the flesh, there was no place he didn’t touch and I was nothing but aching need.

When his mouth suckled my nipple I almost came then. It was too much, not enough, and my hands strained against the bonds. His teeth bit down lightly on the pebbled peak and that was all it took. I shattered, crying out loudly in release.

His hand cupped my mound and I lifted my hips off the bed demanding more. He found my breast and suckled again but it wasn’t enough I wanted his fingers inside me.

“Touch me!” I needed more contact and I didn’t care how brazen my words were.
